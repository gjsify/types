    /**
     * A client for JSON-RPC communication
     *
     * The #JsonrpcClient class provides a convenient API to coordinate with a
     * JSON-RPC server. You can provide the underlying [class`Gio`.IOStream] to communicate
     * with allowing you to control the negotiation of how you setup your
     * communications channel. One such method might be to use a [class`Gio`.Subprocess] and
     * communicate over stdin and stdout.
     *
     * Because JSON-RPC allows for out-of-band notifications from the server to
     * the client, it is important that the consumer of this API calls
     * [method`Client`.close] or [method`Client`.close_async] when they no longer
     * need the client. This is because #JsonrpcClient contains an asynchronous
     * read-loop to process incoming messages. Until [method`Client`.close] or
     * [method`Client`.close_async] have been called, this read loop will prevent
     * the object from finalizing (being freed).
     *
     * To make an RPC call, use [method`Client`.call] or
     * [method`Client`.call_async] and provide the method name and the parameters
     * as a [struct`GLib`.Variant] for call.
     *
     * It is a programming error to mix synchronous and asynchronous API calls
     * of the #JsonrpcClient class.
     *
     * For synchronous calls, #JsonrpcClient will use the thread-default
     * [struct`GLib`.MainContext]. If you have special needs here ensure you've set the context
     * before calling into any #JsonrpcClient API.

         * Complete version of g_object_bind_property().
         *
         * Creates a binding between `source_property` on `source` and `target_property`
         * on `target,` allowing you to set the transformation functions to be used by
         * the binding.
         *
         * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
         * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
         * will be updated as well. The `transform_from` function is only used in case
         * of bidirectional bindings, otherwise it will be ignored
         *
         * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
         * `target` instances are finalized. This will release the reference that is
         * being held on the #GBinding instance; if you want to hold on to the
         * #GBinding instance, you will need to hold a reference to it.
         *
         * To remove the binding, call g_binding_unbind().
         *
         * A #GObject can have multiple bindings.
         *
         * The same `user_data` parameter will be used for both `transform_to`
         * and `transform_from` transformation functions; the `notify` function will
         * be called once, when the binding is removed. If you need different data
         * for each transformation function, please use
         * g_object_bind_property_with_closures() instead.
