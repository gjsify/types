         * The default behaviors listed in `flags` have an effect similar
         * to installing default handlers for the widget’s drag-and-drop signals
         * (#GtkWidget::drag-motion, #GtkWidget::drag-drop, ...). They all exist
         * for convenience. When passing #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_ALL for instance it is
         * sufficient to connect to the widget’s #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
         * signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.
         *
         * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
         * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
         * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
         * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
         * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
         * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
         * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
         * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
         *
         * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
         * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
         * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
