    /**
     * An event triggering feedback to the user
     *
     * #LfbEvent represents an event that should trigger
     * audio, haptic and/or visual feedback to the user by triggering
     * feedback on a feedback daemon. Valid event names are specified
     * in the
     * [Event naming specification](Event-naming-spec-0.0.0.html).
     *
     * One event can trigger multiple feedbacks at once (e.g. audio and
     * haptic feedback). This is determined by the feedback theme in
     * use (which is not under the appliction's control) and the active
     * feedback profile (see [func`Lfb`.set_feedback_profile]().
     *
     * After initializing the library via [func`Lfb`.init]() feedback can be
     * triggered like:
     *
     * ```c
     *   g_autoptr (GError) err = NULL;
     *   LfbEvent *event = lfb_event_new ("message-new-instant");
     *   lfb_event_set_timeout (event, 0);
     *   if (!lfb_event_trigger_feedback (event, &err))
     *     g_warning ("Failed to trigger feedback: %s", err->message);
     * ```
     *
     * When all feedback for this event has ended the [signal`LfbEvent:`:feedback-ended]
     * signal is emitted. If you want to end the feedback ahead of time use
     * [method`LfbEvent`.end_feedback]():
     *
     * ```c
     *   if (!lfb_event_end_feedback (event, &err))
     *     g_warning ("Failed to end feedback: %s", err->message);
     * ```
     *
     * Since these methods involve DBus calls there are asynchronous variants
     * available, e.g. [method`LfbEvent`.trigger_feedback_async]():
     *
     * ```c
     *   static void
     *   on_feedback_triggered (LfbEvent      *event,
     *                          GAsyncResult  *res,
     *                          gpointer      unused)
     *   {
     *      g_autoptr (GError) err = NULL;
     *      if (!lfb_event_trigger_feedback_finish (event, res, &err)) {
     *         g_warning ("Failed to trigger feedback for %s: %s",
     *                    lfb_event_get_event (event), err->message);
