     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * ```c

     * Will result in the "sensitive" property of the widget #GObject instance to be
     * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
     * instance.
     * 
     * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.
     * 
     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
     * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.

     * Destroys a widget.
     * 
     * When a widget is destroyed all references it holds on other objects
     * will be released:
     * 
     *  - if the widget is inside a container, it will be removed from its
     *  parent

     *  of top level widgets that GTK+ maintains internally
     * 
     * It's expected that all references held on the widget will also

     * using g_object_ref(), are held on it. In case additional references
