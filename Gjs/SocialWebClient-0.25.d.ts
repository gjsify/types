     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a

     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     *
