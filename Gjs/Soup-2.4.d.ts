     * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
     * instance.
     * 
     * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.
     * 
     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
     * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.

     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.

     * #SoupMessage:request-headers, and #SoupMessage:request-body fields
     * will be filled in.
     * 
     * After determining what to do with the request, the callback must at
     * a minimum call soup_message_set_status() (or
     * soup_message_set_status_full()) on the message to set the response
     * status code. Additionally, it may set response headers and/or fill

     * 
     * If the callback cannot fully fill in the response before returning
     * (eg, if it needs to wait for information from a database, or
     * another network server), it should call soup_server_pause_message()
     * to tell `server` to not send the response right away. When the
     * response is ready, call soup_server_unpause_message() to cause it
     * to be sent.
     * 
     * To send the response body a bit at a time using "chunked" encoding,
     * first call soup_message_headers_set_encoding() to set
     * %SOUP_ENCODING_CHUNKED on the #SoupMessage:response-headers. Then call
     * soup_message_body_append() (or soup_message_body_append_buffer())
     * to append each chunk as it becomes ready, and
     * soup_server_unpause_message() to make sure it's running. (The
     * server will automatically pause the message if it is using chunked
     * encoding but no more chunks are available.) When you are done, call

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
