 * <![CDATA[         Values of this enumeration indicate the extent to which metadata           such as aliases and group memberships can be stored for the contacts           on a particular connection.          On some protocols, certain metadata (for instance, contact aliases)           can only be stored for contacts on the contact list, or contacts           with a particular contact list state.          To make it easier to deal with such protocols, if clients set           metadata on a contact who is not in the required state, the           Connection MUST cache the metadata for the duration of the session.           If clients request the attributes of that contact after the           appropriate "set" method has returned successfully, the Connection           MUST return the new (cached) value.          If the contact is later placed in the required state to store           metadata (for instance, if subscription to the contact's presence           is requested, on a protocol like MSN where the alias has storage type           Subscribed_Or_Pending), the connection MUST store the cached           metadata at that time.                     If the Connection didn't cache changes in this way, a client             intending to change the alias on MSN would have to wait until             the server acknowledged the subscription request; in the meantime,             other clients would still display the old alias.                   The only exception to that general rule is that if the Connection           cannot store particular metadata at all (i.e. the           storage type is None), it MUST reject attempts to set it.                     If the implementation knows that metadata can't be stored at             all, it's useful to report that, which can be done             synchronously. In general, user interfaces should detect             storage type None and not display editing controls at all.                ]]>

Exactly how this is achieved varies by             channel type.            For StreamTube channels, this access control type             may only be used on UNIX sockets.             The connecting process must send a byte when             it first connects, which is not considered to be part of the data             stream. If the operating system uses sendmsg() with SCM_CREDS or             SCM_CREDENTIALS to pass credentials over sockets, the connecting             process must do so if possible; if not, it must still send the             byte, without any attached credentials. (This mechanism is             very similar to the first byte of a D-Bus connection, except that             in D-Bus the byte is always zero, whereas in Tubes it can be             nonzero.)            For DBusTube channels, this access control type             may be used on any type of socket, and there is no extra byte             added by Telepathy at the beginning of the stream: all bytes in             the stream are part of the D-Bus tube connection. The connecting             process should prove its identity via any of the SASL             authentication mechanisms usually used for D-Bus (in typical             D-Bus implementations this involves either sending and receiving             credentials as above, or demonstrating the ability to write to a             file in the user's home directory).            In either case, the listening process will disconnect the             connection unless it can determine by OS-specific means that             the connecting process has the same user ID as the listening             process.            In either tube type, the associated variant must be ignored.         ]]>

     * 
     * Some channels (those with flags that include
     * %TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_CHANNEL_SPECIFIC_HANDLES) have a concept of
     * "channel-specific handles". These are handles that only have meaning within
     * the context of the channel - for instance, in XMPP Multi-User Chat,
     * participants in a chatroom are identified by an in-room JID consisting
     * of the JID of the chatroom plus a local nickname.
     * 
     * Depending on the protocol and configuration, it might be possible to find
     * out what globally valid handle (i.e. an identifier that you could add to
     * your contact list) "owns" a channel-specific handle. For instance, in
     * most XMPP MUC chatrooms, normal users cannot see what global JID
     * corresponds to an in-room JID, but moderators can.
     * 
     * This is further complicated by the fact that channels with channel-specific
     * handles can sometimes have members with globally valid handles (for
     * instance, if you invite someone to an XMPP MUC using their globally valid
     * JID, you would expect to see the handle representing that JID in the
     * Group's remote-pending set).
     * 
     * This function's result is undefined unless the channel is ready
     * and its flags include %TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_PROPERTIES (an implementation
     * without extra D-Bus round trips is not possible using the older API).

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *

     * ```
     *

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
