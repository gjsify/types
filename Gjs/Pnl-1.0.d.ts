     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user
     * moves the cursor over the widget during a drag. The signal handler
     * must determine whether the cursor position is in a drop zone or not.
     * If it is not in a drop zone, it returns %FALSE and no further processing
     * is necessary. Otherwise, the handler returns %TRUE. In this case, the
     * handler is responsible for providing the necessary information for
     * displaying feedback to the user, by calling gdk_drag_status().
     * 
     * If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected can't be
     * made based solely on the cursor position and the type of the data, the
     * handler may inspect the dragged data by calling gtk_drag_get_data() and

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system
     * currently in use. Some windowing systems, such as Wayland, do not
     * support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the

     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager

     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The

     * 
     * The dimensions returned by this function are suitable for being
     * stored across sessions; use gtk_window_set_default_size() to
     * restore them when before showing the window.
     *

     * function in response to a size change notification, for instance
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal, or
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::configure-event signal:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget, GtkAllocation *allocation)
     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }

     * 
     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
     * you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user
     * moves the cursor over the widget during a drag. The signal handler
     * must determine whether the cursor position is in a drop zone or not.
     * If it is not in a drop zone, it returns %FALSE and no further processing
     * is necessary. Otherwise, the handler returns %TRUE. In this case, the

     * displaying feedback to the user, by calling gdk_drag_status().

     * If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected can't be

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     *
