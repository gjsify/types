/**
 * Appsink is a sink plugin that supports many different methods for making
 * the application get a handle on the GStreamer data in a pipeline. Unlike
 * most GStreamer elements, Appsink provides external API functions.
 * 
 * appsink can be used by linking to the gstappsink.h header file to access the
 * methods or by using the appsink action signals and properties.
 * 
 * The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
 * gst_app_sink_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_pull_preroll() methods.
 * These methods block until a sample becomes available in the sink or when the
 * sink is shut down or reaches EOS. There are also timed variants of these
 * methods, gst_app_sink_try_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_try_pull_preroll(),
 * which accept a timeout parameter to limit the amount of time to wait.
 * 
 * Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming
 * thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast enough, this queue
 * will consume a lot of memory over time. The "max-buffers" property can be
 * used to limit the queue size. The "drop" property controls whether the
 * streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum
 * queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively
 * affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
 * 
 * If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the "emit-signals" property
 * to %TRUE will make appsink emit the "new-sample" and "new-preroll" signals
 * when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
 * 
 * The "caps" property on appsink can be used to control the formats that
 * appsink can receive. This property can contain non-fixed caps, the format of
 * the pulled samples can be obtained by getting the sample caps.
 * 
 * If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return %NULL, the appsink

/**
 * The appsrc element can be used by applications to insert data into a
 * GStreamer pipeline. Unlike most GStreamer elements, appsrc provides
 * external API functions.
 * 
 * appsrc can be used by linking with the libgstapp library to access the
 * methods directly or by using the appsrc action signals.
 * 
 * Before operating appsrc, the caps property must be set to fixed caps
 * describing the format of the data that will be pushed with appsrc. An
 * exception to this is when pushing buffers with unknown caps, in which case no
 * caps should be set. This is typically true of file-like sources that push raw
 * byte buffers. If you don't want to explicitly set the caps, you can use
 * gst_app_src_push_sample. This method gets the caps associated with the
 * sample and sets them on the appsrc replacing any previously set caps (if
 * different from sample's caps).
 * 
 * The main way of handing data to the appsrc element is by calling the
 * gst_app_src_push_buffer() method or by emitting the push-buffer action signal.
 * This will put the buffer onto a queue from which appsrc will read from in its
 * streaming thread. It is important to note that data transport will not happen
 * from the thread that performed the push-buffer call.
 * 
 * The "max-bytes", "max-buffers" and "max-time" properties control how much
 * data can be queued in appsrc before appsrc considers the queue full. A
 * filled internal queue will always signal the "enough-data" signal, which
 * signals the application that it should stop pushing data into appsrc. The
 * "block" property will cause appsrc to block the push-buffer method until
 * free data becomes available again.
 * 
 * When the internal queue is running out of data, the "need-data" signal is
 * emitted, which signals the application that it should start pushing more data
 * into appsrc.
 * 
 * In addition to the "need-data" and "enough-data" signals, appsrc can emit the
 * "seek-data" signal when the "stream-mode" property is set to "seekable" or
 * "random-access". The signal argument will contain the new desired position in
 * the stream expressed in the unit set with the "format" property. After
 * receiving the seek-data signal, the application should push-buffers from the
 * new position.
 * 
 * These signals allow the application to operate the appsrc in two different
 * ways:
 * 
 * The push mode, in which the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer/push-sample
 * method with a new buffer/sample. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc
 * can be controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
 * stopping/starting the push-buffer/push-sample calls. This is a typical
 * mode of operation for the stream-type "stream" and "seekable". Use this
 * mode when implementing various network protocols or hardware devices.
 * 
 * The pull mode, in which the need-data signal triggers the next push-buffer call.
 * This mode is typically used in the "random-access" stream-type. Use this
 * mode for file access or other randomly accessible sources. In this mode, a
 * buffer of exactly the amount of bytes given by the need-data signal should be
 * pushed into appsrc.
 * 
 * In all modes, the size property on appsrc should contain the total stream
 * size in bytes. Setting this property is mandatory in the random-access mode.
 * For the stream and seekable modes, setting this property is optional but
 * recommended.
 * 
 * When the application has finished pushing data into appsrc, it should call
 * gst_app_src_end_of_stream() or emit the end-of-stream action signal. After
 * this call, no more buffers can be pushed into appsrc until a flushing seek
 * occurs or the state of the appsrc has gone through READY.
