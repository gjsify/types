     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     *     before sending off to a printer.  This may produce raster images which
     *     exceed Cairo's limits.  The "printing" functions will detect this condition
