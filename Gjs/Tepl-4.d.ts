     * when the mouse moves past a certain threshold distance after a button-press.
     * Pass the `event` that you have in your #GtkWidget::motion-notify-event handler.

     * The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * will be released:
     * 
     *  - if the widget is inside a container, it will be removed from its
     *  parent
     *  - if the widget is a container, all its children will be destroyed,
     *  recursively
     *  - if the widget is a top level, it will be removed from the list
     *  of top level widgets that GTK+ maintains internally
     * 
     * It's expected that all references held on the widget will also
     * be released; you should connect to the #GtkWidget::destroy signal
     * if you hold a reference to `widget` and you wish to remove it when
     * this function is called. It is not necessary to do so if you are
     * implementing a #GtkContainer, as you'll be able to use the
     * #GtkContainerClass.remove() virtual function for that.
     * 
     * It's important to notice that gtk_widget_destroy() will only cause
     * the `widget` to be finalized if no additional references, acquired
     * using g_object_ref(), are held on it. In case additional references
     * are in place, the `widget` will be in an "inert" state after calling
     * this function; `widget` will still point to valid memory, allowing you
     * to release the references you hold, but you may not query the widget's
     * own state.
     * 
     * You should typically call this function on top level widgets, and
     * rarely on child widgets.

     * When a widget is destroyed all references it holds on other objects
     * will be released:
     * 
     *  - if the widget is inside a container, it will be removed from its
     *  parent
     *  - if the widget is a container, all its children will be destroyed,
     *  recursively
     *  - if the widget is a top level, it will be removed from the list
     *  of top level widgets that GTK+ maintains internally
     * 
     * It's expected that all references held on the widget will also
     * be released; you should connect to the #GtkWidget::destroy signal
     * if you hold a reference to `widget` and you wish to remove it when
     * this function is called. It is not necessary to do so if you are
     * implementing a #GtkContainer, as you'll be able to use the
     * #GtkContainerClass.remove() virtual function for that.
     * 
     * It's important to notice that gtk_widget_destroy() will only cause
     * the `widget` to be finalized if no additional references, acquired
     * using g_object_ref(), are held on it. In case additional references
     * are in place, the `widget` will be in an "inert" state after calling
     * this function; `widget` will still point to valid memory, allowing you
     * to release the references you hold, but you may not query the widget's
     * own state.
     * 
     * You should typically call this function on top level widgets, and
     * rarely on child widgets.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
