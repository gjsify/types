     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
