     * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
     * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
     * 
     * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
     * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
     * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
     * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is

     * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
     * 
     * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
     * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
     * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
     * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
     * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
     * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
     * 
     * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
     * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
     * `arg_data` is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
     * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
     * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
     * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
     * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
     * 
     * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
     * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b`

     * of Unicode commandline arguments).
     * 
     * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You

     * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options

     * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
     * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
     * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
     * the process.
     * 
     * What happens next depends on the flags: if
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
     * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
     * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
     * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
     * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
     * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
     * via the #GApplication::open signal.
     * 
     * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
     * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
     * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
     * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
     * suppress the default handling. See
     * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c]
     * for an example.
     * 
     * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
     * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
     * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
     * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
     * 
     * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
     * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
     * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
     * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
     * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
     * use.
     * 
     * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,

     * 
     * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
     * for the duration that the application is running.
     * 
     * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
     * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER are given as flags) will check (from the

     * commandline processing is interrupted and the
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
     * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
     * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
     * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
     * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
     * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
     * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```

     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
     *              GdkDragContext *context,

     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing

     * on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget, GtkAllocation *allocation)
     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
     * you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to
     * the signal handler, as the allocation may contain client side
     * decorations added by GTK+, depending on the windowing system in
     * use.
     * 
     * If you are getting a window size in order to position the window
     * on the screen, you should, instead, simply set the window’s semantic
     * type with gtk_window_set_type_hint(), which allows the window manager
     * to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of
     * dialogs with gtk_window_set_transient_for() window managers will
     * often center the dialog over its parent window. It's much preferred
     * to let the window manager handle these cases rather than doing it
     * yourself, because all apps will behave consistently and according to
     * user or system preferences, if the window manager handles it. Also,
     * the window manager can take into account the size of the window
     * decorations and border that it may add, and of which GTK+ has no

     * Sets a widget as a potential drop destination, and adds default behaviors.
     * 
     * The default behaviors listed in `flags` have an effect similar
     * to installing default handlers for the widget’s drag-and-drop signals
     * (#GtkWidget::drag-motion, #GtkWidget::drag-drop, ...). They all exist
     * for convenience. When passing #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_ALL for instance it is
     * sufficient to connect to the widget’s #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
     * signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.
     * 
     * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:

     * ```c
     * static void
