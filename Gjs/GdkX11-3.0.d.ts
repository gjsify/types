     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * used in the keymap, since, for instance, `<Control>` would be
     * masked out even if only `<Control><Alt>` was used in the keymap.
     * To support this usage as well as well as possible, all single
     * modifier combinations that could affect the key for any combination
     * of modifiers will be returned in `consumed_modifiers;` multi-modifier
     * combinations are returned only when actually found in `state`. When

     * Indicates that you are beginning the process of redrawing `region`.
     * A backing store (offscreen buffer) large enough to contain `region`
     * will be created. The backing store will be initialized with the
     * background color or background surface for `window`. Then, all
     * drawing operations performed on `window` will be diverted to the
     * backing store.  When you call gdk_window_end_paint(), the backing
     * store will be copied to `window,` making it visible onscreen. Only
     * the part of `window` contained in `region` will be modified; that is,
     * drawing operations are clipped to `region`.
     * 
     * The net result of all this is to remove flicker, because the user
     * sees the finished product appear all at once when you call
     * gdk_window_end_paint(). If you draw to `window` directly without
     * calling gdk_window_begin_paint_region(), the user may see flicker
     * as individual drawing operations are performed in sequence.  The
     * clipping and background-initializing features of
     * gdk_window_begin_paint_region() are conveniences for the
     * programmer, so you can avoid doing that work yourself.
     * 
     * When using GTK+, the widget system automatically places calls to
     * gdk_window_begin_paint_region() and gdk_window_end_paint() around
     * emissions of the expose_event signal. That is, if you’re writing an
     * expose event handler, you can assume that the exposed area in
     * #GdkEventExpose has already been cleared to the window background,
     * is already set as the clip region, and already has a backing store.
     * Therefore in most cases, application code need not call
     * gdk_window_begin_paint_region(). (You can disable the automatic
     * calls around expose events on a widget-by-widget basis by calling
     * gtk_widget_set_double_buffered().)
     * 
     * If you call this function multiple times before calling the
     * matching gdk_window_end_paint(), the backing stores are pushed onto
     * a stack. gdk_window_end_paint() copies the topmost backing store
     * onscreen, subtracts the topmost region from all other regions in
     * the stack, and pops the stack. All drawing operations affect only
     * the topmost backing store in the stack. One matching call to
     * gdk_window_end_paint() is required for each call to
     * gdk_window_begin_paint_region().
