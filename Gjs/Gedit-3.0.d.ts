     * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
     * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
     * 
     * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
     * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
     * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
     * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
     * possible to either use `arg_data` in the usual way, or to consult (and
     * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
     * 
     * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
     * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
     * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
     * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
     * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
     * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
     * 
     * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
     * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
     * `arg_data` is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
     * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
     * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
     * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
     * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
     * 
     * The dict includes options that have been explicitly specified on the parsed
     * commandline, as well as zero values for numeric options that were not
     * necessarily specified.

     * of Unicode commandline arguments).
     * 
     * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You

     * application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
     * 
     * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
     * such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
     * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
     * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
     * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
     * the process.
     * 
     * What happens next depends on the flags: if
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
     * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
     * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
     * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
     * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
     * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
     * via the #GApplication::open signal.
     * 
     * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
     * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
     * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
     * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
     * suppress the default handling. See
     * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c]
     * for an example.
     * 
     * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
     * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
     * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
     * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
     * 
     * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
     * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
     * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
     * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
     * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
     * use.
     * 
     * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
     * to the basename of argv[0].
     * 
     * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
     * for the duration that the application is running.
     * 
     * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
     * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER are given as flags) will check (from the
     * default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
     * was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
     * commandline processing is interrupted and the
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
     * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
     * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
     * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
     * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
     * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
     * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
     * should not be used from applications like editors that need precise

     * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,

     * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system
     * currently in use. Some windowing systems, such as Wayland, do not
     * support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the

     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager

     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to

     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The

     * the user preferences and that may not be visibile at the time you
     * call this function.
     * 
     * The dimensions returned by this function are suitable for being
     * stored across sessions; use gtk_window_set_default_size() to
     * restore them when before showing the window.
     * 
     * To avoid potential race conditions, you should only call this
     * function in response to a size change notification, for instance
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal, or
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::configure-event signal:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget, GtkAllocation *allocation)
     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
     * you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to
