/**
 * A quaternion is comprised of a scalar component and a 3D vector
 * component. The scalar component is normally referred to as w and the
 * vector might either be referred to as v or a (for axis) or expanded
 * with the individual components: (x, y, z) A full quaternion would
 * then be written as <literal>[w (x, y, z)]</literal>.
 * 
 * Quaternions can be considered to represent an axis and angle
 * pair although sadly these numbers are buried somewhat under some
 * maths...
 * 
 * For the curious you can see here that a given axis (a) and angle (𝜃)
 * pair are represented in a quaternion as follows:
 * |[
 * [w=cos(𝜃/2) ( x=sin(𝜃/2)*a.x, y=sin(𝜃/2)*a.y, z=sin(𝜃/2)*a.x )]
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * Unit Quaternions:
 * When using Quaternions to represent spatial orientations for 3D
 * graphics it's always assumed you have a unit quaternion. The
 * magnitude of a quaternion is defined as:
 * |[
 * sqrt (w² + x² + y² + z²)
 * ```
 * 
 * and a unit quaternion satisfies this equation:
 * |[
 * w² + x² + y² + z² = 1
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * Thankfully most of the time we don't actually have to worry about
 * the maths that goes on behind the scenes but if you are curious to
 * learn more here are some external references:
