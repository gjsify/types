/**
 * A callback function used by the type system to initialize the class
 * of a specific type.
 * 
 * This function should initialize all static class members.
 * 
 * The initialization process of a class involves:
 * 
 * - Copying common members from the parent class over to the
 *   derived class structure.
 * - Zero initialization of the remaining members not copied
 *   over from the parent class.
 * - Invocation of the GBaseInitFunc() initializers of all parent
 *   types and the class' type.
 * - Invocation of the class' GClassInitFunc() initializer.
 * 
 * Since derived classes are partially initialized through a memory copy
 * of the parent class, the general rule is that GBaseInitFunc() and
 * GBaseFinalizeFunc() should take care of necessary reinitialization
 * and release of those class members that were introduced by the type
 * that specified these GBaseInitFunc()/GBaseFinalizeFunc().
 * GClassInitFunc() should only care about initializing static
 * class members, while dynamic class members (such as allocated strings
 * or reference counted resources) are better handled by a GBaseInitFunc()
 * for this type, so proper initialization of the dynamic class members
 * is performed for class initialization of derived types as well.
 * 
 * An example may help to correspond the intend of the different class
 * initializers:
 * 
 * 
 * ```c
 * typedef struct {
 *   GObjectClass parent_class;
 *   gint         static_integer;
 *   gchar       *dynamic_string;
 * } TypeAClass;
 * static void
 * type_a_base_class_init (TypeAClass *class)
 * {
 *   class->dynamic_string = g_strdup ("some string");
 * }
 * static void
 * type_a_base_class_finalize (TypeAClass *class)
 * {
 *   g_free (class->dynamic_string);
 * }
 * static void
 * type_a_class_init (TypeAClass *class)
 * {
 *   class->static_integer = 42;
 * }
 * 
 * typedef struct {
 *   TypeAClass   parent_class;
 *   gfloat       static_float;
 *   GString     *dynamic_gstring;
 * } TypeBClass;
 * static void
 * type_b_base_class_init (TypeBClass *class)
 * {
 *   class->dynamic_gstring = g_string_new ("some other string");
 * }
 * static void
 * type_b_base_class_finalize (TypeBClass *class)
 * {
 *   g_string_free (class->dynamic_gstring);
 * }
 * static void
 * type_b_class_init (TypeBClass *class)
 * {
 *   class->static_float = 3.14159265358979323846;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * Initialization of TypeBClass will first cause initialization of
 * TypeAClass (derived classes reference their parent classes, see
 * g_type_class_ref() on this).
 * 
 * Initialization of TypeAClass roughly involves zero-initializing its fields,
 * then calling its GBaseInitFunc() type_a_base_class_init() to allocate
 * its dynamic members (dynamic_string), and finally calling its GClassInitFunc()
 * type_a_class_init() to initialize its static members (static_integer).
 * The first step in the initialization process of TypeBClass is then
 * a plain memory copy of the contents of TypeAClass into TypeBClass and
 * zero-initialization of the remaining fields in TypeBClass.
 * The dynamic members of TypeAClass within TypeBClass now need
 * reinitialization which is performed by calling type_a_base_class_init()
 * with an argument of TypeBClass.
 * 
 * After that, the GBaseInitFunc() of TypeBClass, type_b_base_class_init()
 * is called to allocate the dynamic members of TypeBClass (dynamic_gstring),
 * and finally the GClassInitFunc() of TypeBClass, type_b_class_init(),
 * is called to complete the initialization process with the static members
 * (static_float).
 * 
 * Corresponding finalization counter parts to the GBaseInitFunc() functions
 * have to be provided to release allocated resources at class finalization
 * time.

     * This function checks to see if the object is still floating, and if so,
     * unsets the floating state and decreases the reference count. If the

     * 
     * 
     * Because g_source_set_closure() (and similar functions) take ownership of the

     * 
     * 
     * ```c

     * Generally, this function is used together with g_closure_ref(). An example
     * of storing a closure for later notification looks like:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * static GClosure *notify_closure = NULL;
     * void
     * foo_notify_set_closure (GClosure *closure)
     * {
     *   if (notify_closure)
     *     g_closure_unref (notify_closure);

     *       g_closure_sink (notify_closure);
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Because g_closure_sink() may decrement the reference count of a closure
     * (if it hasn't been called on `closure` yet) just like g_closure_unref(),
