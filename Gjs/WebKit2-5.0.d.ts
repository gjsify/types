     * Creates a binding between `source_property` on `source` and `target_property`
     * on `target`.
     * 
     * Whenever the `source_property` is changed the `target_property` is
     * updated using the same value. For instance:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     *   g_object_bind_property (action, "active", widget, "sensitive", 0);
     * ```

     * 
     * Will result in the "sensitive" property of the widget #GObject instance to be
     * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
     * instance.
     * 
     * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.
     * 
     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
     * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.

     * is not safe to rely on this if the binding, `source` or `target` can be
