     * for convenience. When passing #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_ALL for instance it is
     * sufficient to connect to the widget’s #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
     * signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.
     * 
     * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
     *              GdkDragContext *context,
     *              gint x,

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user
     * moves the cursor over the widget during a drag. The signal handler
     * must determine whether the cursor position is in a drop zone or not.
     * If it is not in a drop zone, it returns %FALSE and no further processing
     * is necessary. Otherwise, the handler returns %TRUE. In this case, the
     * handler is responsible for providing the necessary information for
     * displaying feedback to the user, by calling gdk_drag_status().
     * 
     * If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected can't be
     * made based solely on the cursor position and the type of the data, the
     * handler may inspect the dragged data by calling gtk_drag_get_data() and
     * defer the gdk_drag_status() call to the #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
     * handler. Note that you must pass #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP,

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * It's expected that all references held on the widget will also
     * be released; you should connect to the #GtkWidget::destroy signal
     * if you hold a reference to `widget` and you wish to remove it when
     * this function is called. It is not necessary to do so if you are
     * implementing a #GtkContainer, as you'll be able to use the
     * #GtkContainerClass.remove() virtual function for that.

     * the `widget` to be finalized if no additional references, acquired
     * using g_object_ref(), are held on it. In case additional references
     * are in place, the `widget` will be in an "inert" state after calling
     * this function; `widget` will still point to valid memory, allowing you
     * to release the references you hold, but you may not query the widget's
     * own state.
     * 
     * You should typically call this function on top level widgets, and
     * rarely on child widgets.
