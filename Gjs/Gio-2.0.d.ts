     * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow expired

     * presented by the client, if this was requested via the server's
     * #GDtlsServerConnection:authentication_mode. On the server side,
     * the signal is always emitted when the client presents a
     * certificate, and the certificate will only be accepted if a
     * handler returns %TRUE.
     * 
     * Note that if this signal is emitted as part of asynchronous I/O
     * in the main thread, then you should not attempt to interact with
     * the user before returning from the signal handler. If you want to

     * the next time.

     * If you are doing I/O in another thread, you do not

     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
     * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
     * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
     * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
     * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
     * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
     * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
     * certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
     * property of each certificate in `chain`. Since GLib 2.48, this no
     * longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
     * represent the actual certification path used during certificate
     * verification.
     * 
     * Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
     * perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
     * For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
     * revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
     * certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
     * handle the verification.
     * 
     * The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
     * to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
     * certificates.
     * 
     * This function can block. Use g_tls_database_verify_chain_async() to

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice

     * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
     * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
     * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
     * 
     * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
     * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
     * `arg_data` is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
     * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
     * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
     * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
     * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).

     * commandline, as well as zero values for numeric options that were not
     * necessarily specified.

     * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s`

     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use `x`

     * the `argc,` `argv` parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
     * to pass %NULL if `argv` is not available or commandline handling is not
     * required.  Note that on Windows, `argc` and `argv` are ignored, and
     * g_win32_get_command_line() is called internally (for proper support
     * of Unicode commandline arguments).
     * 
     * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
     * can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
     * g_application_add_main_option_entries().  After this, the
     * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal is emitted, from which the
     * application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
     * 
     * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
     * such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
     * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
     * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
     * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
     * the process.
     * 
     * What happens next depends on the flags: if
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
     * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
     * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
     * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
     * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
     * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
     * via the #GApplication::open signal.
     * 
     * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
     * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
     * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
     * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
     * suppress the default handling. See
     * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c]
     * for an example.
     * 
     * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
     * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
     * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
     * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
     * 
     * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
     * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
     * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
     * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
     * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
     * use.
     * 
     * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
     * to the basename of argv[0].
     * 
     * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
     * for the duration that the application is running.
     * 
     * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
     * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER are given as flags) will check (from the
     * default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
     * was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
     * commandline processing is interrupted and the
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
     * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
     * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
     * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
     * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
     * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
     * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
     * should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
     * control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
     * what their exit status will be.

     * 
     * - Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
     *   with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
     *   begin with a digit.
     * 
     * - Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
     *   (and thus at least two elements).
     * 
     * - Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.
     * 
     * - Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.
     * 
     * Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
     * but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
     * refer to D-Bus, such as
     * [Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
     * the
     * [`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
     * and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
     * resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
     * require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
     * identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.
     * 
     * Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
     * reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
     * it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
     * words run together, with initial capital letters.
     * 
     * As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
     * hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
     * contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
     * For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an
     * archiving application, it might be named `org._7_zip.Archiver`.

     * both. If its not possible to do any work an error is returned.
     * 
     * Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).
     * Also a call may produce output even if given no input, due to state stored
     * in the converter producing output.
     * 
     * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
     * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
     * next call.
     * 
     * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
     * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
     * data after the data in `inbuf,` the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
     * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
     * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
     * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED

     * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
     * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
     * 
     * When some data has successfully been converted `bytes_read` and is set to
     * the number of bytes read from `inbuf,` and `bytes_written` is set to indicate
     * how many bytes was written to `outbuf`. If there are more data to output
     * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
     * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
     * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
     * 
     * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and `error` is set accordingly.
     * Some errors need special handling:
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
     * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
     * call the function again with a larger `outbuf` to continue.
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
     * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
     * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
     * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
     * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
     * further input). It may also happen when `inbuf_size` is zero and
     * there is no more data to produce.
     * 
     * When this happens the application should read more input and then
     * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
     * more data call the function again with the same data but with
     * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
     * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
     * input is actually partial).
     * 
     * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
     * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
     * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
     * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
     * initial state.
     * 
     * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
     * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
     * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
     * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
     * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
     * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
     * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
     * but done in the middle of the data.
     * 
     * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
     * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
     * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
     * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
     * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
     * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
     * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
     * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
     * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
     * 
     * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
     * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
     * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
     * (typically %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT).

     * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
     * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
     * next call.
     * 
     * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
     * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
     * data after the data in `inbuf,` the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
     * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
     * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
     * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED
     * may be returned even if %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is not set, for instance
     * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
     * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
     * 
     * When some data has successfully been converted `bytes_read` and is set to
     * the number of bytes read from `inbuf,` and `bytes_written` is set to indicate
     * how many bytes was written to `outbuf`. If there are more data to output
     * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
     * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
     * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
     * 
     * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and `error` is set accordingly.
     * Some errors need special handling:
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
     * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
     * call the function again with a larger `outbuf` to continue.
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
     * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
     * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
     * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
     * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
     * further input). It may also happen when `inbuf_size` is zero and
     * there is no more data to produce.
     * 
     * When this happens the application should read more input and then
     * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
     * more data call the function again with the same data but with
     * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
     * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
     * input is actually partial).
     * 
     * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
     * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
     * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
     * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
     * initial state.
     * 
     * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
     * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
     * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
     * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
     * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
     * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
     * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
     * but done in the middle of the data.
     * 
     * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
     * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
     * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
     * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
     * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
     * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
     * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
     * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
     * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
     * 
     * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
     * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
     * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
     * (typically %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT).

     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,

     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.

     * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
     * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
     * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
     * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
     * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
     * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
     * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * g_socket_receive_messages(); for easier use, see
     * g_socket_receive() and g_socket_receive_from().
     * 
     * If `address` is non-%NULL then `address` will be set equal to the
     * source address of the received packet.
     * `address` is owned by the caller.
     * 
     * `vector` must point to an array of #GInputVector structs and
     * `num_vectors` must be the length of this array.  These structs
     * describe the buffers that received data will be scattered into.
     * If `num_vectors` is -1, then `vectors` is assumed to be terminated
     * by a #GInputVector with a %NULL buffer pointer.
     * 
     * As a special case, if `num_vectors` is 0 (in which case, `vectors`
     * may of course be %NULL), then a single byte is received and
     * discarded. This is to facilitate the common practice of sending a
     * single '\0' byte for the purposes of transferring ancillary data.
     * 
     * `messages,` if non-%NULL, will be set to point to a newly-allocated
     * array of #GSocketControlMessage instances or %NULL if no such
     * messages was received. These correspond to the control messages
     * received from the kernel, one #GSocketControlMessage per message
     * from the kernel. This array is %NULL-terminated and must be freed
     * by the caller using g_free() after calling g_object_unref() on each
     * element. If `messages` is %NULL, any control messages received will
     * be discarded.
     * 
     * `num_messages,` if non-%NULL, will be set to the number of control
     * messages received.
     * 
     * If both `messages` and `num_messages` are non-%NULL, then
     * `num_messages` gives the number of #GSocketControlMessage instances
     * in `messages` (ie: not including the %NULL terminator).
     * 
     * `flags` is an in/out parameter. The commonly available arguments
     * for this are available in the #GSocketMsgFlags enum, but the
     * values there are the same as the system values, and the flags
     * are passed in as-is, so you can pass in system-specific flags too
     * (and g_socket_receive_message() may pass system-specific flags out).
     * Flags passed in to the parameter affect the receive operation; flags returned
     * out of it are relevant to the specific returned message.
     * 
     * As with g_socket_receive(), data may be discarded if `socket` is
     * %G_SOCKET_TYPE_DATAGRAM or %G_SOCKET_TYPE_SEQPACKET and you do not
     * provide enough buffer space to read a complete message. You can pass
     * %G_SOCKET_MSG_PEEK in `flags` to peek at the current message without
     * removing it from the receive queue, but there is no portable way to find
     * out the length of the message other than by reading it into a
     * sufficiently-large buffer.
     * 
     * If the socket is in blocking mode the call will block until there
     * is some data to receive, the connection is closed, or there is an
     * error. If there is no data available and the socket is in
     * non-blocking mode, a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error will be
     * returned. To be notified when data is available, wait for the
     * %G_IO_IN condition.
     * 
     * On error -1 is returned and `error` is set accordingly.

     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,

     * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial

     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,

     * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
     * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
     * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
     * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     *

     * certificate in the chain by its #GTlsCertificate:issuer property.
     * 
     * `purpose` describes the purpose (or usage) for which the certificate
     * is being used. Typically `purpose` will be set to #G_TLS_DATABASE_PURPOSE_AUTHENTICATE_SERVER
     * which means that the certificate is being used to authenticate a server
     * (and we are acting as the client).
     * 
     * The `identity` is used to ensure the server certificate is valid for
     * the expected peer identity. If the identity does not match the
     * certificate, %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_BAD_IDENTITY will be set in the
     * return value. If `identity` is %NULL, that bit will never be set in
     * the return value. The peer identity may also be used to check for
     * pinned certificates (trust exceptions) in the database. These may
     * override the normal verification process on a host-by-host basis.
     * 
     * Currently there are no `flags,` and %G_TLS_DATABASE_VERIFY_NONE should be
     * used.
     * 
     * If `chain` is found to be valid, then the return value will be 0. If
     * `chain` is found to be invalid, then the return value will indicate at
     * least one problem found. If the function is unable to determine
     * whether `chain` is valid (for example, because `cancellable` is
     * triggered before it completes) then the return value will be
     * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and `error` will be set accordingly.
     * `error` is not set when `chain` is successfully analyzed but found to
     * be invalid.
     * 
     * GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
     * error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
     * that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
     * decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
     * be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
     * expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
     * error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
     * 
     * Prior to GLib 2.48, GLib's default TLS backend modified `chain` to
     * represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
     * certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
     * property of each certificate in `chain`. Since GLib 2.48, this no
     * longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
     * represent the actual certification path used during certificate
     * verification.
     * 
     * Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
     * perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
     * For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
     * revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
     * certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
     * handle the verification.
     * 
     * The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
     * to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
     * certificates.
     * 
     * This function can block. Use g_tls_database_verify_chain_async() to
     * perform the verification operation asynchronously.

     * return value. If `identity` is %NULL, that bit will never be set in
     * the return value. The peer identity may also be used to check for
     * pinned certificates (trust exceptions) in the database. These may
     * override the normal verification process on a host-by-host basis.
     * 
     * Currently there are no `flags,` and %G_TLS_DATABASE_VERIFY_NONE should be
     * used.
     * 
     * If `chain` is found to be valid, then the return value will be 0. If
     * `chain` is found to be invalid, then the return value will indicate at
     * least one problem found. If the function is unable to determine
     * whether `chain` is valid (for example, because `cancellable` is
     * triggered before it completes) then the return value will be
     * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and `error` will be set accordingly.
     * `error` is not set when `chain` is successfully analyzed but found to
     * be invalid.
     * 
     * GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
     * error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
     * that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
     * decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
     * be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
     * expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
     * error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
     * 
     * Prior to GLib 2.48, GLib's default TLS backend modified `chain` to
     * represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
     * certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
     * property of each certificate in `chain`. Since GLib 2.48, this no
     * longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
     * represent the actual certification path used during certificate
     * verification.
     * 
     * Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
     * perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
     * For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
     * revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
     * certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
     * handle the verification.
     * 
     * The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
     * to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
     * certificates.
     * 
     * This function can block. Use g_tls_database_verify_chain_async() to
     * perform the verification operation asynchronously.

     * 
     * Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).

     * 
     * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
     * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
     * next call.
     * 
     * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
     * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
     * data after the data in `inbuf,` the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
     * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
     * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
     * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED

     * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
     * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
     * 
     * When some data has successfully been converted `bytes_read` and is set to
     * the number of bytes read from `inbuf,` and `bytes_written` is set to indicate
     * how many bytes was written to `outbuf`. If there are more data to output
     * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
     * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
     * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
     * 
     * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and `error` is set accordingly.
     * Some errors need special handling:
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
     * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
     * call the function again with a larger `outbuf` to continue.
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
     * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
     * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
     * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
     * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
     * further input). It may also happen when `inbuf_size` is zero and
     * there is no more data to produce.
     * 
     * When this happens the application should read more input and then
     * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
     * more data call the function again with the same data but with
     * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
     * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
     * input is actually partial).
     * 
     * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
     * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
     * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
     * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
     * initial state.
     * 
     * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
     * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
     * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
     * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
     * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
     * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
     * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
     * but done in the middle of the data.
     * 
     * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
     * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
     * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
     * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
     * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
     * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
     * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
     * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
     * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
     * 
     * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
     * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
     * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error

     * both. If its not possible to do any work an error is returned.
     * 
     * Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).
     * Also a call may produce output even if given no input, due to state stored
     * in the converter producing output.
     * 
     * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
     * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
     * next call.
     * 
     * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
     * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
     * data after the data in `inbuf,` the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
     * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
     * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
     * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED
     * may be returned even if %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is not set, for instance
     * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
     * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
     * 
     * When some data has successfully been converted `bytes_read` and is set to
     * the number of bytes read from `inbuf,` and `bytes_written` is set to indicate
     * how many bytes was written to `outbuf`. If there are more data to output
     * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
     * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
     * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
     * 
     * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and `error` is set accordingly.
     * Some errors need special handling:
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
     * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
     * call the function again with a larger `outbuf` to continue.
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
     * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
     * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
     * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
     * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
     * further input). It may also happen when `inbuf_size` is zero and
     * there is no more data to produce.
     * 
     * When this happens the application should read more input and then
     * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
     * more data call the function again with the same data but with
     * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
     * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
     * input is actually partial).
     * 
     * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
     * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
     * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
     * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
     * initial state.
     * 
     * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
     * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
     * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
     * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
     * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
     * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
     * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
     * but done in the middle of the data.
     * 
     * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
     * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
     * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
     * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
     * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
     * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
     * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
     * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
     * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
     * 
     * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
     * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
     * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
     * (typically %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT).

     * multiple times in a loop, and each time it will do some work, i.e.
     * producing some output (in `outbuf)` or consuming some input (from `inbuf)` or
     * both. If its not possible to do any work an error is returned.
     * 
     * Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).
     * Also a call may produce output even if given no input, due to state stored
     * in the converter producing output.
     * 
     * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
     * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
     * next call.
     * 
     * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
     * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
     * data after the data in `inbuf,` the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
     * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
     * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
     * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED
     * may be returned even if %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is not set, for instance
     * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
     * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
     * 
     * When some data has successfully been converted `bytes_read` and is set to
     * the number of bytes read from `inbuf,` and `bytes_written` is set to indicate
     * how many bytes was written to `outbuf`. If there are more data to output
     * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
     * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
     * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
     * 
     * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and `error` is set accordingly.
     * Some errors need special handling:
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
     * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
     * call the function again with a larger `outbuf` to continue.
     * 
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
     * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
     * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
     * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
     * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
     * further input). It may also happen when `inbuf_size` is zero and
     * there is no more data to produce.
     * 
     * When this happens the application should read more input and then
     * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
     * more data call the function again with the same data but with
     * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
     * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
     * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
     * input is actually partial).
     * 
     * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
     * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
     * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
     * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
     * initial state.
     * 
     * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
     * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
     * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
     * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
     * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
     * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
     * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
     * but done in the middle of the data.
     * 
     * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
     * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
     * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
     * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
     * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
     * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
     * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
     * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
     * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
     * 
     * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
     * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
     * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
     * (typically %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT).
