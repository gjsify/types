     * `context` will be updated, and if it is %NULL, then the complete meta store will be updated. Detailed
     * explanations follow:
     * 
     * In order to keep the meta store's contents in a consistent state, the update process involves updating
     * the contents of all the tables related to one where the contents change. For example the "_columns"
     * table (which lists all the columns of a table) depends on the "_tables" table (which lists all the tables
     * in a schema), so if a row is added, removed or modified in the "_tables", then the "_columns" table's contents
     * needs to be updated as well regarding that row.
     * 
     * If `context` is %NULL, then the update process will simply overwrite any data that was present in all the
     * meta store's tables with new (up to date) data even if nothing has changed, without having to build the
     * tables' dependency tree. This is the recommended way of proceeding when dealing with a meta store which
     * might be outdated.
     * 
     * On the other hand, if `context` is not %NULL, then a tree of the dependencies has to be built (depending on
     * `context)` and only some parts of the meta store are updated following that dependencies tree. Specifying a
     * context may be useful for example in the following situations:
     * <itemizedlist>
     *   <listitem><para>One knows that a database object has changed (for example a table created), and
     *                   may use the `context` to request that only the information about that table be updated
     *             </para></listitem>
     *   <listitem><para>One is only interested in the list of views, and may request that only the information
     *                   about views may be updated</para></listitem>
     * </itemizedlist>
     * 
     * When `context` is not %NULL, and contains specified SQL identifiers (for example the "table_name" of the "_tables"
     * table), then each SQL identifier has to match the convention the #GdaMetaStore has adopted regarding
     * case sensitivity, using gda_connection_quote_sql_identifier() or gda_meta_store_sql_identifier_quote().
     * 
     * see the <link linkend="information_schema:sql_identifiers">
     * meta data section about SQL identifiers</link> for more information, and the documentation about the
     * gda_sql_identifier_quote() function which will be most useful.
     * 
     * Note however that usually <emphasis>more</emphasis> information will be updated than strictly requested by
     * the `context` argument.
     * 
     * For more information, see the <link linkend="information_schema">Database structure</link> section, and

     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     *

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     *

     * updated using the same value. For instance:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     *   g_object_bind_property (action, "active", widget, "sensitive", 0);
     * ```

     * 
     * Will result in the "sensitive" property of the widget #GObject instance to be
     * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
     * instance.
     * 
     * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.
     * 
     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
     * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.
     * 
     * Removing the binding by calling g_object_unref() on it must only be done if
     * the binding, `source` and `target` are only used from a single thread and it
