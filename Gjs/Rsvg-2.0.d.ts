     *   than rendering the whole document, for example.
     * 
     * * This function cannot deal with percentage-based units for `width`
     *   and `height` because there is no viewport against which they could
     *   be resolved; that is why it will compute the extents of objects in that case.  This

     * pixels, so you should call rsvg_handle_set_dpi() beforehand.
     * 
     * Note that `cr` must be a Cairo context that is not in an error state, that is,

     * * If the SVG document has both `width` and `height`
     *   attributes with physical units (px, in, cm, mm, pt, pc) or font-based units (em,
     *   ex), the function computes the size directly based on the dots-per-inch (DPI) you
     *   have configured with rsvg_handle_set_dpi().  This is the same approach as
     *   rsvg_handle_get_intrinsic_size_in_pixels().
     * 
     * * Otherwise, if there is a `viewBox` attribute and both
     *   `width` and `height` are set to
     *   `100%` (or if they don't exist at all and thus default to 100%),
     *   the function uses the width and height of the `viewBox` as a pixel size.  This
     *   produces a rendered document with the correct aspect ratio.
     * 
     * * Otherwise, this function computes the extents of every graphical object in the SVG
     *   document to find the total extents.  This is moderately expensive, but no more expensive
     *   than rendering the whole document, for example.
     * 
     * * This function cannot deal with percentage-based units for `width`
     *   and `height` because there is no viewport against which they could
     *   be resolved; that is why it will compute the extents of objects in that case.  This
     *   is why we recommend that you use rsvg_handle_render_layer() instead, which takes
     *   in a viewport and follows the sizing policy from the web platform.
     * 
     * Drawing will occur with respect to the `cr'`s current transformation: for example, if
     * the `cr` has a rotated current transformation matrix, the whole SVG will be rotated in
     * the rendered version.
     * 
     * This function depends on the `RsvgHandle`'s DPI to compute dimensions in
     * pixels, so you should call rsvg_handle_set_dpi() beforehand.
     * 
     * Note that `cr` must be a Cairo context that is not in an error state, that is,
     * cairo_status() must return `CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS` for it.  Cairo can set a
