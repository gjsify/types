     * In simple terms, queries the `width`, `height`, and `viewBox` attributes in an SVG document.

     * 
     * Before librsvg 2.54.0, the `out_has_width` and `out_has_height` arguments would be set to true or false
     * depending on whether the SVG document actually had `width` and `height` attributes, respectively.
     * 
     * However, since librsvg 2.54.0, `width` and `height` are now [geometry
     * properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/geometry.html) per the SVG2 specification; they
     * are not plain attributes.  SVG2 made it so that the initial value of those properties
     * is `auto`, which is equivalent to specifing a value of `100%`.  In this sense, even SVG
     * documents which lack `width` or `height` attributes semantically have to make them
     * default to `100%`.  This is why since librsvg 2.54.0, `out_has_width` and
     * `out_has_heigth` are always returned as `TRUE`, since with SVG2 all documents *have* a
     * default width and height of `100%`.
     * 
     * As an example, the following SVG element has a `width` of 100 pixels and a `height` of 400 pixels, but no `viewBox`.  This
     * function will return those sizes in `out_width` and `out_height`, and set `out_has_viewbox` to `FALSE`.

     * set `out_has_viewbox` to `TRUE`, and it will also set `out_has_width` and `out_has_height` to `TRUE` but

     * <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 400">

     * will return width and height values whose `units` fields are `RSVG_UNIT_MM`.

/**
 * [class`Rsvg`.Handle] loads an SVG document into memory.
 * 
 * This is the main entry point into the librsvg library.  An [class`Rsvg`.Handle] is an
 * object that represents SVG data in memory.  Your program creates an
 * [class`Rsvg`.Handle] from an SVG file, or from a memory buffer that contains SVG data,
 * or in the most general form, from a `GInputStream` that will provide SVG data.
 * 
 * Librsvg can load SVG images and render them to Cairo surfaces,
 * using a mixture of SVG's [static mode] and [secure static mode].
 * Librsvg does not do animation nor scripting, and can load
 * references to external data only in some situations; see below.
 * 
 * Librsvg supports reading [SVG 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) data, and is gradually
 * adding support for features in [SVG 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/).  Librsvg also
 * supports SVGZ files, which are just an SVG stream compressed with the GZIP algorithm.
 * 
 * [static mode]: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/conform.html#static-mode
 * [secure static mode]: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/conform.html#secure-static-mode
 * 
 * # The "base file" and resolving references to external files
 * 
 * When you load an SVG, librsvg needs to know the location of the "base file"
 * for it.  This is so that librsvg can determine the location of referenced
 * entities.  For example, say you have an SVG in `/foo/bar/foo.svg`
 * and that it has an image element like this:
 * 
 * ```
 * <image href="resources/foo.png" .../>
 * ```
 * 
 * In this case, librsvg needs to know the location of the toplevel
 * `/foo/bar/foo.svg` so that it can generate the appropriate
 * reference to `/foo/bar/resources/foo.png`.
 * 
 * ## Security and locations of referenced files
 * 
 * When processing an SVG, librsvg will only load referenced files if they are
 * in the same directory as the base file, or in a subdirectory of it.  That is,
 * if the base file is `/foo/bar/baz.svg`, then librsvg will
 * only try to load referenced files (from SVG's
 * `<image>` element, for example, or from content
 * included through XML entities) if those files are in `/foo/bar/*` or in `/foo/bar/*\/.../*`.
 * This is so that malicious SVG files cannot include files that are in a directory above.
 * 
 * The full set of rules for deciding which URLs may be loaded is as follows;
 * they are applied in order.  A referenced URL will not be loaded as soon as
 * one of these rules fails:
 * 
 * 1. All `data:` URLs may be loaded.  These are sometimes used
 *    to include raster image data, encoded as base-64, directly in an SVG file.
 * 
 * 2. All other URL schemes in references require a base URL.  For
 *    example, this means that if you load an SVG with
 *    [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new_from_data] without calling [method`Rsvg`.Handle.set_base_uri],
 *    then any referenced files will not be allowed (e.g. raster images to be
 *    loaded from other files will not work).
 * 
 * 3. If referenced URLs are absolute, rather than relative, then they must
 *    have the same scheme as the base URL.  For example, if the base URL has a
 *    `file` scheme, then all URL references inside the SVG must
 *    also have the `file` scheme, or be relative references which
 *    will be resolved against the base URL.
 * 
 * 4. If referenced URLs have a `resource` scheme, that is,
 *    if they are included into your binary program with GLib's resource
 *    mechanism, they are allowed to be loaded (provided that the base URL is
 *    also a `resource`, per the previous rule).
 * 
 * 5. Otherwise, non-`file` schemes are not allowed.  For
 *    example, librsvg will not load `http` resources, to keep
 *    malicious SVG data from "phoning home".
 * 
 * 6. A relative URL must resolve to the same directory as the base URL, or to
 *    one of its subdirectories.  Librsvg will canonicalize filenames, by
 *    removing ".." path components and resolving symbolic links, to decide whether
 *    files meet these conditions.
 * 
 * # Loading an SVG with GIO
 * 
 * This is the easiest and most resource-efficient way of loading SVG data into
 * an [class`Rsvg`.Handle].
 * 
 * If you have a `GFile` that stands for an SVG file, you can simply call
 * [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new_from_gfile_sync] to load an [class`Rsvg`.Handle] from it.
 * 
 * Alternatively, if you have a `GInputStream`, you can use
 * [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new_from_stream_sync].
 * 
 * Both of those methods allow specifying a `GCancellable`, so the loading
 * process can be cancelled from another thread.
 * 
 * ## Loading an SVG from memory
 * 
 * If you already have SVG data in a byte buffer in memory, you can create a
 * memory input stream with [ctor`Gio`.MemoryInputStream.new_from_data] and feed that
 * to [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new_from_stream_sync].
 * 
 * Note that in this case, it is important that you specify the base_file for
 * the in-memory SVG data.  Librsvg uses the base_file to resolve links to
 * external content, like raster images.
 * 
 * # Loading an SVG without GIO
 * 
 * You can load an [class`Rsvg`.Handle] from a simple filename or URI with
 * [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new_from_file].  Note that this is a blocking operation; there
 * is no way to cancel it if loading a remote URI takes a long time.  Also, note that
 * this method does not let you specify [flags`Rsvg`.HandleFlags].
 * 
 * Otherwise, loading an SVG without GIO is not recommended, since librsvg will
 * need to buffer your entire data internally before actually being able to
 * parse it.  The deprecated way of doing this is by creating a handle with
 * [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new] or [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new_with_flags], and then using
 * [method`Rsvg`.Handle.write] and [method`Rsvg`.Handle.close] to feed the handle with SVG data.
 * Still, please try to use the GIO stream functions instead.
 * 
 * # Resolution of the rendered image (dots per inch, or DPI)
 * 
 * SVG images can contain dimensions like "`5cm`" or
 * "`2pt`" that must be converted from physical units into
 * device units.  To do this, librsvg needs to know the actual dots per inch
 * (DPI) of your target device.  You can call [method`Rsvg`.Handle.set_dpi] or
 * [method`Rsvg`.Handle.set_dpi_x_y] on an [class`Rsvg`.Handle] to set the DPI before rendering
 * it.
 * 
 * # Rendering
 * 
 * The preferred way to render a whole SVG document is to use
 * [method`Rsvg`.Handle.render_document].  Please see its documentation for
 * details.
 * 
 * # API ordering
 * 
 * Due to the way the librsvg API evolved over time, an [class`Rsvg`.Handle] object is available
 * for use as soon as it is constructed.  However, not all of its methods can be
 * called at any time.  For example, an [class`Rsvg`.Handle] just constructed with [ctor`Rsvg`.Handle.new]
 * is not loaded yet, and it does not make sense to call [method`Rsvg`.Handle.render_document] on it
 * just at that point.
 * 
 * The documentation for the available methods in [class`Rsvg`.Handle] may mention that a particular
 * method is only callable on a "fully loaded handle".  This means either:
 * 
 * * The handle was loaded with [method`Rsvg`.Handle.write] and [method`Rsvg`.Handle.close], and
 *   those functions returned no errors.
 * 
 * * The handle was loaded with [method`Rsvg`.Handle.read_stream_sync] and that function
 *   returned no errors.
 * 
 * Before librsvg 2.46, the library did not fully verify that a handle was in a
 * fully loaded state for the methods that require it.  To preserve
 * compatibility with old code which inadvertently called the API without
 * checking for errors, or which called some methods outside of the expected
 * order, librsvg will just emit a `g_critical()` message in those cases.
 * 
 * New methods introduced in librsvg 2.46 and later will check for the correct
 * ordering, and panic if they are called out of order.  This will abort
 * the program as if it had a failed assertion.
