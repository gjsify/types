     * You don't necessarily need to be root when using libguestfs. However you
     * obviously do need sufficient permissions to access the filename for
     * whatever operations you want to perform (ie. read access if you just
     * want to read the image or write access if you want to modify the image).
     * 
     * This call checks that filename exists.
     * 
     * filename may be the special string "/dev/null". See "NULL DISKS" in
     * guestfs(3).
     * 
     * The optional arguments are:
     * 
     * `readonly`
     * If true then the image is treated as read-only. Writes are still
     * allowed, but they are stored in a temporary snapshot overlay which
     * is discarded at the end. The disk that you add is not modified.
     * 
     * `format`
     * This forces the image format. If you omit this (or use
     * guestfs_session_add_drive() or guestfs_session_add_drive_ro()) then
     * the format is automatically detected. Possible formats include `raw`
     * and `qcow2`.
     * 
     * Automatic detection of the format opens you up to a potential
     * security hole when dealing with untrusted raw-format images. See
     * CVE-2010-3851 and <ulink
     * url='https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=642934'>
     * RHBZ&num;642934 </ulink>. Specifying the format closes this security
     * hole.
     * 
     * `iface`
     * This rarely-used option lets you emulate the behaviour of the
     * deprecated guestfs_session_add_drive_with_if() call (q.v.)
     * 
     * `name`
     * The name the drive had in the original guest, e.g. /dev/sdb. This is
     * used as a hint to the guest inspection process if it is available.
     * 
     * `label`
     * Give the disk a label. The label should be a unique, short string
     * using *only* ASCII characters "[a-zA-Z]". As well as its usual name
     * in the API (such as /dev/sda), the drive will also be named
     * /dev/disk/guestfs/*label*.
     * 
     * See "DISK LABELS" in guestfs(3).
     * 
     * `protocol`
     * The optional protocol argument can be used to select an alternate
     * source protocol.
     * 
     * See also: "REMOTE STORAGE" in guestfs(3).
     * 
     * "protocol = "file""
     * filename is interpreted as a local file or device. This is the
     * default if the optional protocol parameter is omitted.
     * 
     * "protocol = "ftp"|"ftps"|"http"|"https"|"tftp""

     * 
     * <![CDATA[unix:/path/to/socket]]>
     * 
     * If the port number is omitted, then the standard port number for the
     * protocol is used (see /etc/services).
     * 
     * `username`
     * For the `ftp,` `ftps,` `http,` `https,` `iscsi,` `rbd,` `ssh` and `tftp`
     * protocols, this specifies the remote username.
     * 
     * If not given, then the local username is used for `ssh,` and no
     * authentication is attempted for ceph. But note this sometimes may
     * give unexpected results, for example if using the libvirt backend
     * and if the libvirt backend is configured to start the qemu appliance
     * as a special user such as "qemu.qemu". If in doubt, specify the
     * remote username you want.
     * 
     * `secret`
     * For the `rbd` protocol only, this specifies the ‘secret’ to use when
     * connecting to the remote device. It must be base64 encoded.
     * 
     * If not given, then a secret matching the given username will be
     * looked up in the default keychain locations, or if no username is
     * given, then no authentication will be used.
     * 
     * `cachemode`
     * Choose whether or not libguestfs will obey sync operations (safe but
     * slow) or not (unsafe but fast). The possible values for this string
     * are:
     * 
     * "cachemode = "writeback""
     * This is the default.
     * 
     * Write operations in the API do not return until a write(2) call
     * has completed in the host [but note this does not imply that
     * anything gets written to disk].
     * 
     * Sync operations in the API, including implicit syncs caused by
     * filesystem journalling, will not return until an fdatasync(2)
     * call has completed in the host, indicating that data has been
     * committed to disk.
     * 
     * "cachemode = "unsafe""
     * In this mode, there are no guarantees. Libguestfs may cache
     * anything and ignore sync requests. This is suitable only for
     * scratch or temporary disks.
     * 
     * `discard`
     * Enable or disable discard (a.k.a. trim or unmap) support on this
     * drive. If enabled, operations such as guestfs_session_fstrim() will
     * be able to discard / make thin / punch holes in the underlying host
     * file or device.
     * 
     * Possible discard settings are:
     * 
     * "discard = "disable""
     * Disable discard support. This is the default.
     * 
     * "discard = "enable""
     * Enable discard support. Fail if discard is not possible.
     * 
     * "discard = "besteffort""
     * Enable discard support if possible, but don't fail if it is not
     * supported.
     * 
     * Since not all backends and not all underlying systems support
     * discard, this is a good choice if you want to use discard if
     * possible, but don't mind if it doesn't work.
     * 
     * `copyonread`
     * The boolean parameter `copyonread` enables copy-on-read support. This
     * only affects disk formats which have backing files, and causes reads
     * to be stored in the overlay layer, speeding up multiple reads of the
     * same area of disk.

     * This function returns an icon corresponding to the inspected operating

     * (re-encoded to PNG if necessary).
     * 
     * If it was not possible to get an icon this function returns a
     * zero-length (non-NULL) buffer. *Callers must check for this case*.
     * 
     * Libguestfs will start by looking for a file called /etc/favicon.png or
     * C:\etc\favicon.png and if it has the correct format, the contents of
     * this file will be returned. You can disable favicons by passing the
     * optional `favicon` boolean as false (default is true).
     * 
     * If finding the favicon fails, then we look in other places in the guest
     * for a suitable icon.
     * 
     * If the optional `highquality` boolean is true then only high quality
     * icons are returned, which means only icons of high resolution with an
     * alpha channel. The default (false) is to return any icon we can, even if
     * it is of substandard quality.
     * 
     * Notes:
     * 
     * *   Unlike most other inspection API calls, the guest’s disks must be
     * mounted up before you call this, since it needs to read information
     * from the guest filesystem during the call.
     * 
     * *   Security: The icon data comes from the untrusted guest, and should
     * be treated with caution. PNG files have been known to contain
     * exploits. Ensure that libpng (or other relevant libraries) are fully
     * up to date before trying to process or display the icon.
     * 
     * *   The PNG image returned can be any size. It might not be square.
     * Libguestfs tries to return the largest, highest quality icon
     * available. The application must scale the icon to the required size.
     * 
     * *   Extracting icons from Windows guests requires the external `wrestool`
     * program from the `icoutils` package, and several programs (`bmptopnm,`
     * `pnmtopng,` `pamcut)` from the `netpbm` package. These must be
     * installed separately.

     * 
     * `force`
     * Force tune2fs to complete the operation even in the face of errors.
     * This is the same as the tune2fs `-f` option.
     * 
     * `maxmountcount`
     * Set the number of mounts after which the filesystem is checked by
     * e2fsck(8). If this is `0` then the number of mounts is disregarded.
     * This is the same as the tune2fs `-c` option.
     * 
     * `mountcount`
     * Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted. This is the
     * same as the tune2fs `-C` option.
     * 
     * `errorbehavior`
     * Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are detected.
     * Possible values currently are: `continue,` `remount-ro,` `panic`. In
     * practice these options don't really make any difference,
     * particularly for write errors.
     * 
     * This is the same as the tune2fs `-e` option.
     * 
     * `group`
     * Set the group which can use reserved filesystem blocks. This is the
     * same as the tune2fs `-g` option except that it can only be specified
     * as a number.
     * 
     * `intervalbetweenchecks`
     * Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks (in seconds).
     * If the option is passed as `0` then time-dependent checking is
     * disabled.
     * 
     * This is the same as the tune2fs `-i` option.
     * 
     * `reservedblockspercentage`
     * Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only be allocated by
     * privileged processes. This is the same as the tune2fs `-m` option.
     * 
     * `lastmounteddirectory`
     * Set the last mounted directory. This is the same as the tune2fs `-M`
     * option.
     * 
     * `reservedblockscount` Set the number of reserved filesystem blocks. This
     * is the same as the tune2fs `-r` option.
     * `user`
     * Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks. This is the
     * same as the tune2fs `-u` option except that it can only be specified
     * as a number.
     *
