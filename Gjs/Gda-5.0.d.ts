 *       as <emphasis>MyTable</emphasis> (note that in the end the database may still decide
 *       to name the table <emphasis>mytable</emphasis> or differently if it can't do

 * </itemizedlist>
 * 
 * Additional information about the GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_THREAD_SAFE and GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_THREAD_ISOLATED flags:
 * The GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_THREAD_SAFE flag specifies that it has to be able to use the returned connection object from
 * several threads at once (locking is ensured by the #GdaConnection itself). Depending on the database provider's
 * implementation and on the native libraries it uses, the "normal" connection object might not respect this requirement,
 * and in this case a specific thread is started and used as the unique thread which will manipulate the actual connection,
 * while a "wrapper connection" is actually returned and used by the caller (that wrapper connection passes method calls
 * from the calling thread to the actual connection's specific thread, and gets the results back).
 * 
 * The GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_THREAD_ISOLATED forces using a specific thread and a "wrapper connection" even if the
 * "normal" connection would itself be thread safe; this is useful for example to be sure the asynchronous API can
 * always be used (see gda_connection_async_statement_execute()).
 * 
 * Having a specific thread and a "wrapper connection" definitely has an impact on the performances (because it involves
 * messages passing between threads for every method call), so using the
 * GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_THREAD_SAFE or GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_THREAD_ISOLATED flags should be carefully considered.
 * 
 * Note about the `GDA_CONNECTION_OPTIONS_AUTO_META_DATA` flag:
 * <itemizedlist>
 *  <listitem><para>Every time a DDL statement is successfully executed, the associated meta data, if
 *               defined, will be updated, which has a impact on performances</para></listitem>
 *  <listitem><para>If a transaction is started and some DDL statements are executed and the transaction
 *            is not rolled back or committed, then the meta data may end up being wrong</para></listitem>

     * `context` will be updated, and if it is %NULL, then the complete meta store will be updated. Detailed
     * explanations follow:
     * 
     * In order to keep the meta store's contents in a consistent state, the update process involves updating
     * the contents of all the tables related to one where the contents change. For example the "_columns"
     * table (which lists all the columns of a table) depends on the "_tables" table (which lists all the tables
     * in a schema), so if a row is added, removed or modified in the "_tables", then the "_columns" table's contents
     * needs to be updated as well regarding that row.
     * 
     * If `context` is %NULL, then the update process will simply overwrite any data that was present in all the
     * meta store's tables with new (up to date) data even if nothing has changed, without having to build the
     * tables' dependency tree. This is the recommended way of proceeding when dealing with a meta store which
     * might be outdated.
     * 
     * On the other hand, if `context` is not %NULL, then a tree of the dependencies has to be built (depending on
     * `context)` and only some parts of the meta store are updated following that dependencies tree. Specifying a
     * context may be useful for example in the following situations:
     * <itemizedlist>
     *   <listitem><para>One knows that a database object has changed (for example a table created), and
     *                   may use the `context` to request that only the information about that table be updated
     *             </para></listitem>
     *   <listitem><para>One is only interested in the list of views, and may request that only the information
     *                   about views may be updated</para></listitem>
     * </itemizedlist>
     * 
     * When `context` is not %NULL, and contains specified SQL identifiers (for example the "table_name" of the "_tables"
     * table), then each SQL identifier has to match the convention the #GdaMetaStore has adopted regarding
     * case sensitivity, using gda_connection_quote_sql_identifier() or gda_meta_store_sql_identifier_quote().
     * 
     * see the <link linkend="information_schema:sql_identifiers">
     * meta data section about SQL identifiers</link> for more information, and the documentation about the
     * gda_sql_identifier_quote() function which will be most useful.
     * 
     * Note however that usually <emphasis>more</emphasis> information will be updated than strictly requested by
     * the `context` argument.
     * 
     * For more information, see the <link linkend="information_schema">Database structure</link> section, and

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
