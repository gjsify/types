     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
