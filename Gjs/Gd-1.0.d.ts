     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note the difference in behavior vs. gtk_widget_get_ancestor();
     * `gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_WINDOW)`
     * would return
     * %NULL if `widget` wasn’t inside a toplevel window, and if the
     * window was inside a #GtkWindow-derived widget which was in turn
     * inside the toplevel #GtkWindow. While the second case may
     * seem unlikely, it actually happens when a #GtkPlug is embedded
     * inside a #GtkSocket within the same application.
     * 
     * To reliably find the toplevel #GtkWindow, use
     * gtk_widget_get_toplevel() and call GTK_IS_WINDOW()

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * to installing default handlers for the widget’s drag-and-drop signals
     * (#GtkWidget::drag-motion, #GtkWidget::drag-drop, ...). They all exist
     * for convenience. When passing #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_ALL for instance it is
     * sufficient to connect to the widget’s #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
     * signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.
     * 
     * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
     *              GdkDragContext *context,
     *              gint x,
     *              gint y,

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * gtk_widget_child_focus():
     * 
     * When %TRUE is returned, stay in the widget, the failed keyboard
     * navigation is OK and/or there is nowhere we can/should move the
     * focus to.
     * 
     * When %FALSE is returned, the caller should continue with keyboard
     * navigation outside the widget, e.g. by calling
     * gtk_widget_child_focus() on the widget’s toplevel.
     * 
     * The default ::keynav-failed handler returns %FALSE for
     * %GTK_DIR_TAB_FORWARD and %GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD. For the other
     * values of #GtkDirectionType it returns %TRUE.
     * 
     * Whenever the default handler returns %TRUE, it also calls
     * gtk_widget_error_bell() to notify the user of the failed keyboard
     * navigation.
     * 
     * A use case for providing an own implementation of ::keynav-failed
     * (either by connecting to it or by overriding it) would be a row of
     * #GtkEntry widgets where the user should be able to navigate the

     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * accept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly.
     * However in some strange cases a widget may be allocated less than
     * its requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated more
     * space than it requested.
     * 
     * If the size request in a given direction is -1 (unset), then
     * the “natural” size request of the widget will be used instead.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * value should be interpreted in a way similar to the return value of
     * gtk_widget_child_focus():
     * 
     * When %TRUE is returned, stay in the widget, the failed keyboard
     * navigation is OK and/or there is nowhere we can/should move the
     * focus to.
     * 
     * When %FALSE is returned, the caller should continue with keyboard
     * navigation outside the widget, e.g. by calling
     * gtk_widget_child_focus() on the widget’s toplevel.
     * 
     * The default ::keynav-failed handler returns %FALSE for
     * %GTK_DIR_TAB_FORWARD and %GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD. For the other
     * values of #GtkDirectionType it returns %TRUE.
     * 
     * Whenever the default handler returns %TRUE, it also calls
     * gtk_widget_error_bell() to notify the user of the failed keyboard
     * navigation.
     * 
     * A use case for providing an own implementation of ::keynav-failed
     * (either by connecting to it or by overriding it) would be a row of
     * #GtkEntry widgets where the user should be able to navigate the

     * 
     * Whenever the `source_property` is changed the `target_property` is
     * updated using the same value. For instance:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     *   g_object_bind_property (action, "active", widget, "sensitive", 0);

     * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
     * instance.
     * 
     * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.
     * 
     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the

     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
