     * One way to avoid using g_object_notify() from within the
     * class that registered the properties, and using g_object_notify_by_pspec()
     * instead, is to store the GParamSpec used with
     * g_object_class_install_property() inside a static array, e.g.:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     *   enum
     *   {
     *     PROP_0,
     *     PROP_FOO,
     *     PROP_LAST
     *   };
     * 
     *   static GParamSpec *properties[PROP_LAST];
     * 
     *   static void
     *   my_object_class_init (MyObjectClass *klass)
     *   {
     *     properties[PROP_FOO] = g_param_spec_int ("foo", "Foo", "The foo",
     *                                              0, 100,
     *                                              50,
     *                                              G_PARAM_READWRITE);

     * 
     * 
     * and then notify a change on the "foo" property with:
