     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     *   enum
     *   {
     *     PROP_0,
     *     PROP_FOO,

     *   };
     * 
     *   static GParamSpec *properties[PROP_LAST];

     *                                              50,
     *                                              G_PARAM_READWRITE);

     * 
     * 
     * and then notify a change on the "foo" property with:
