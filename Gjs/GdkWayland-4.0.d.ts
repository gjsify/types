     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     *

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
