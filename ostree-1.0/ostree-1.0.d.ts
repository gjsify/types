         *   * `disable-sign-verify-summary` (`b`): Disable signapi verification of the summary
         *   * `depth` (`i`): How far in the history to traverse; default is 0, -1 means infinite

         *   * `disable-static-deltas` (`b`): Do not use static deltas
         *   * `require-static-deltas` (`b`): Require static deltas

         * ref); Since: 2017.11
         *   * `timestamp-check-from-rev` (`s`): Verify that all fetched commit timestamps are newer than
         * timestamp of given rev; Since: 2020.4
         *   * `max-metadata-size` (`t`): Restrict metadata objects to a maximum number of bytes; 0 to
         * disable.  Since: 2018.9
         *   * `dry-run` (`b`): Only print information on what will be downloaded (requires static deltas)

         *   * `inherit-transaction` (`b`): Don't initiate, finish or abort a transaction, useful to do
         * multiple pulls in one transaction.
         *   * `http-headers` (`a(ss)`): Additional headers to add to all HTTP requests
         *   * `update-frequency` (`u`): Frequency to call the async progress callback in milliseconds, if

         * fetches
         *   * `append-user-agent` (`s`): Additional string to append to the user agent
         *   * `n-network-retries` (`u`): Number of times to retry each download on receiving

         *   * `low-speed-limit-bytes` (`u`): The average transfer speed per second of a transfer
         *      during the time set via "low-speed-time-seconds" for libcurl to abort.
         *   * `low-speed-time-seconds` (`u`): The time in number seconds that the transfer
         *      speed should be below the "low-speed-limit-bytes" setting for libcurl to abort.
         *   * `retry-all-network-errors` (`b`): Retry when network issues happen, instead of
         *      failing automatically. Currently only affects libcurl. (Default set to true)
         *   * `max-outstanding-fetcher-requests` (`u`): The max amount of concurrent connections allowed.
         *   * `ref-keyring-map` (`a(sss)`): Array of (collection ID, ref name, keyring
         *     remote name) tuples specifying which remote's keyring should be used when
         *     doing GPG verification of each collection-ref. This is useful to prevent a
         *     remote from serving malicious updates to refs which did not originate from
         *     it. This can be a subset or superset of the refs being pulled; any ref
         *     not being pulled will be ignored and any ref without a keyring remote
         *     will be verified with the keyring of the remote being pulled from.
         *     Since: 2019.2
         *   * `summary-bytes` (`ay'): Contents of the `summary` file to use. If this is

         *     useful if doing multiple pull operations in a transaction, using

         *     the `summary` and `summary.sig` once for the entire transaction. If not
         *     specified, the `summary` will be downloaded from the remote. Since: 2020.5

         *     is specified, `summary-bytes` must also be specified. Since: 2020.5

         * it, and on error create it; and: check if it exists, if not create it.

         * a partially written file as the result). The correct approach is to
         * always try to create the file with `g_file_create()` which will either
         * atomically create the file or fail with a {@link Gio.IOErrorEnum.EXISTS} error.

         * have to fool users that something is possible and then just show an error
