         * general approach to handling that is to not check, but just do the
         * operation and handle the errors as they come.
         *
         * As an example of race-free checking, take the case of reading a file,
         * and if it doesn't exist, creating it. There are two racy versions: read
         * it, and on error create it; and: check if it exists, if not create it.

         * a partially written file as the result). The correct approach is to
         * always try to create the file with g_file_create() which will either
         * atomically create the file or fail with a %G_IO_ERROR_EXISTS error.
         *
         * However, in many cases an existence check is useful in a user interface,
         * for instance to make a menu item sensitive/insensitive, so that you don't
         * have to fool users that something is possible and then just show an error
         * dialog. If you do this, you should make sure to also handle the errors
         * that can happen due to races when you execute the operation.
