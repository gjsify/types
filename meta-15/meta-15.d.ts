     * This class handles tracking and painting the root window background.
     *
     * By integrating with [class`Meta`.WindowGroup] we can avoid painting parts of
     * the background that are obscured by other windows.
     *
     * The overall model drawing model of this content is that we have one
     * texture, or two interpolated textures, possibly with alpha or
     * margins that let the underlying background show through, blended
     * over a solid color or a gradient. The result of that combination
     * can then be affected by a "vignette" that darkens the background
     * away from a central point (or as a no-GLSL fallback, simply darkens
     * the background) and by overall opacity.
     *
     * As of GNOME 3.14, GNOME is only using a fraction of this when the
     * user sets the background through the control center - what can be
     * set is:
     *
     *  A single image without a border
     *  An animation of images without a border that blend together,
     *   with the blend changing every 4-5 minutes
     *  A solid color with a repeated noise texture blended over it
     *
     * This all is pretty easy to do in a fragment shader, except when:
     *
     *  A) We don't have GLSL - in this case, the operation of
     *     interpolating the two textures and blending the result over the
     *     background can't be expressed with Cogl's fixed-function layer
     *     combining (which is confined to what GL's texture environment
     *     combining can do) So we can only handle the above directly if
     *     there are no margins or alpha.
     *
     *  B) The image textures are sliced. Texture size limits on older
     *     hardware (pre-965 intel hardware, r300, etc.)  is often 2048,
     *     and it would be common to use a texture larger than this for a
     *     background and expect it to be scaled down. Cogl can compensate
     *     for this by breaking the texture up into multiple textures, but
     *     can't multitexture with sliced textures. So we can only handle
     *     the above if there's a single texture.
     *
     * However, even when we *can* represent everything in a single pass,
     * it's not necessarily efficient. If we want to draw a 1024x768
     * background, it's pretty inefficient to bilinearly texture from
     * two 2560x1440 images and mix that. So the drawing model we take
     * here is that MetaBackground generates a single texture (which
     * might be a 1x1 texture for a solid color, or a 1x2 texture for a
     * gradient, or a repeated texture for wallpaper, or a pre-rendered
     * texture the size of the screen), and we draw with that, possibly
     * adding the vignette and opacity.

     *
     * - Window was destroyed
     * - Window is minimized
     * - Window is moved to a different desktop
     * - Window no longer sticky.
     *
     * Note that combinations are possible - a window might have first
     * been minimized and then moved to a different desktop. The 'effect' parameter
     * to meta_compositor_show_window() and meta_compositor_hide_window() is a hint
     * as to the appropriate effect to show the user and should not
     * be considered to be indicative of a state change.

     * workspace animation completes.

     * A display-agnostic abstraction for a window.

     * #MetaWindow is the core abstraction in Mutter of a window. It has the
     * properties you'd expect, such as a title, whether it's fullscreen,
     * has decorations, etc.
     *
     * Since a lot of different kinds of windows exist, each window also a
     * [enum`Meta`.WindowType] which denotes which kind of window we're exactly dealing
     * with. For example, one expects slightly different behaviour from a dialog
     * than a "normal" window. The type of a window can be queried with
     * [method`Meta`.Window.get_window_type].
     *
     * Common API for windows include:
     *
     * - Minimizing: [method`Meta`.Window.minimize] / [method`Meta`.Window.unminimize]
     * - Maximizing: [method`Meta`.Window.maximize] / [method`Meta`.Window.unmaximize]
     * - Fullscreen: [method`Meta`.Window.make_fullscreen] / [method`Meta`.Window.unmake_fullscreen]
     *               / [method`Meta`.Window.is_fullscreen]
     *
     * Each #MetaWindow is part of either one or all [class`Meta`.Workspace]s of the
     * desktop. You can activate a window on a certain workspace using
     * [method`Meta`.Window.activate_with_workspace], and query on which workspace it is
     * located using [method`Meta`.Window.located_on_workspace]. The workspace it is part
     * of can be obtained using [method`Meta`.Window.get_workspace].
     *
     * Each display protocol should make a subclass to be compatible with that
     * protocols' specifics, for example #MetaWindowX11 and #MetaWindowWayland.
     * This is independent of the protocol that the client uses, which is modeled
     * using the [enum`Meta`.WindowClientType] enum.
     *
     * To integrate within the Clutter scene graph, which deals with the actual
     * rendering, each #MetaWindow will be part of a [class`Meta`.WindowActor].
