     * When a single timeline element is edited within its timeline at some
     * position, using ges_timeline_element_edit(), depending on the edit
     * mode, its #GESTimelineElement:start, #GESTimelineElement:duration or
     * #GESTimelineElement:in-point will be adjusted accordingly. In addition,
     * any clips may change #GESClip:layer.
     *
     * Each edit can be broken down into a combination of three basic edits:
     *
     * + MOVE: This moves the start of the element to the edit position.
     * + START-TRIM: This cuts or grows the start of the element, whilst
     *   maintaining the time at which its internal content appears in the
     *   timeline data output. If the element is made shorter, the data that
     *   appeared at the edit position will still appear in the timeline at
     *   the same time. If the element is made longer, the data that appeared
     *   at the previous start of the element will still appear in the
     *   timeline at the same time.
     * + END-TRIM: Similar to START-TRIM, but the end of the element is cut or
     *   grown.
     *
     * In particular, when editing a #GESClip:
     *
     * + MOVE: This will set the #GESTimelineElement:start of the clip to the
     *   edit position.
     * + START-TRIM: This will set the #GESTimelineElement:start of the clip
     *   to the edit position. To keep the end time the same, the
     *   #GESTimelineElement:duration of the clip will be adjusted in the
     *   opposite direction. In addition, the #GESTimelineElement:in-point of
     *   the clip will be shifted such that the content that appeared at the
     *   new or previous start time, whichever is latest, still appears at the
     *   same timeline time. For example, if a frame appeared at the start of
     *   the clip, and the start of the clip is reduced, the in-point of the
     *   clip will also reduce such that the frame will appear later within
     *   the clip, but at the same timeline position.
     * + END-TRIM: This will set the #GESTimelineElement:duration of the clip
     *   such that its end time will match the edit position.
     *
     * When editing a #GESGroup:
     *
     * + MOVE: This will set the #GESGroup:start of the clip to the edit
     *   position by shifting all of its children by the same amount. So each
     *   child will maintain their relative positions.
     * + START-TRIM: If the group is made shorter, this will START-TRIM any
     *   clips under the group that start after the edit position to the same
     *   edit position. If the group is made longer, this will START-TRIM any
     *   clip under the group whose start matches the start of the group to
     *   the same edit position.
     * + END-TRIM: If the group is made shorter, this will END-TRIM any clips
     *   under the group that end after the edit position to the same edit
     *   position. If the group is made longer, this will END-TRIM any clip
     *   under the group whose end matches the end of the group to the same
     *   edit position.
     *
     * When editing a #GESTrackElement, if it has a #GESClip parent, this
     * will be edited instead. Otherwise it is edited in the same way as a
     * #GESClip.
     *
     * The layer priority of a #GESGroup is the lowest layer priority of any
     * #GESClip underneath it. When a group is edited to a new layer
     * priority, it will shift all clips underneath it by the same amount,
     * such that their relative layers stay the same.
     *
     * If the #GESTimeline has a #GESTimeline:snapping-distance, then snapping
     * may occur for some of the edges of the **main** edited element:
     *
     * + MOVE: The start or end edge of *any* #GESSource under the element may
     *   be snapped.
     * + START-TRIM: The start edge of a #GESSource whose start edge touches
     *   the start edge of the element may snap.
     * + END-TRIM: The end edge of a #GESSource whose end edge touches the end
     *   edge of the element may snap.
     *
     * These edges may snap with either the start or end edge of *any* other
     * #GESSource in the timeline that is not also being moved by the element,
     * including those in different layers, if they are within the
     * #GESTimeline:snapping-distance. During an edit, only up to one snap can
     * occur. This will shift the edit position such that the snapped edges
     * will touch once the edit has completed.
     *
     * Note that snapping can cause an edit to fail where it would have
     * otherwise succeeded because it may push the edit position such that the
     * edit would result in an unsupported timeline configuration. Similarly,
     * snapping can cause an edit to succeed where it would have otherwise
     * failed.
     *
     * For example, in #GES_EDIT_MODE_RIPPLE acting on #GES_EDGE_NONE, the
     * main element is the MOVED toplevel of the edited element. Any source
     * under the main MOVED toplevel may have its start or end edge snapped.
     * Note, these sources cannot snap with each other. The edit may also
     * push other elements, but any sources under these elements cannot snap,
     * nor can they be snapped with. If a snap does occur, the MOVE of the
     * toplevel *and* all other elements pushed by the ripple will be shifted
     * by the same amount such that the snapped edges will touch.
     *
     * You can also find more explanation about the behaviour of those modes at:
     * [trim, ripple and roll](http://pitivi.org/manual/trimming.html)
     * and [clip management](http://pitivi.org/manual/usingclips.html).

    /**
     * A #GESAsset in the GStreamer Editing Services represents a resources
     * that can be used. In particular, any class that implements the
     * #GESExtractable interface may have some associated assets with a
     * corresponding #GESAsset:extractable-type, from which its objects can be
     * extracted using ges_asset_extract(). Some examples would be
     * #GESClip, #GESFormatter and #GESTrackElement.
     *
     * All assets that are created within GES are stored in a cache; one per
     * each #GESAsset:id and #GESAsset:extractable-type pair. These assets can
     * be fetched, and initialized if they do not yet exist in the cache,
     * using ges_asset_request().
     *
     * ``` c
     * GESAsset *effect_asset;
     * GESEffect *effect;
     *
     * // You create an asset for an effect
     * effect_asset = ges_asset_request (GES_TYPE_EFFECT, "agingtv", NULL);
     *
     * // And now you can extract an instance of GESEffect from that asset
     * effect = GES_EFFECT (ges_asset_extract (effect_asset));
     *
     * ```
     *
     * The advantage of using assets, rather than simply creating the object
     * directly, is that the currently loaded resources can be listed with
     * ges_list_assets() and displayed to an end user. For example, to show
     * which media files have been loaded, and a standard list of effects. In
     * fact, the GES library already creates assets for #GESTransitionClip and
     * #GESFormatter, which you can use to list all the available transition
     * types and supported formats.
     *
     * The other advantage is that #GESAsset implements #GESMetaContainer, so
     * metadata can be set on the asset, with some subclasses automatically
     * creating this metadata on initiation.
     *
     * For example, to display information about the supported formats, you
     * could do the following:
     *
     * ```
     *    GList *formatter_assets, *tmp;
     *
     *    //  List all  the transitions
     *    formatter_assets = ges_list_assets (GES_TYPE_FORMATTER);
     *
     *    // Print some infos about the formatter GESAsset
     *    for (tmp = formatter_assets; tmp; tmp = tmp->next) {
     *      gst_print ("Name of the formatter: %s, file extension it produces: %s",
     *        ges_meta_container_get_string (
     *          GES_META_CONTAINER (tmp->data), GES_META_FORMATTER_NAME),
     *        ges_meta_container_get_string (
     *          GES_META_CONTAINER (tmp->data), GES_META_FORMATTER_EXTENSION));
     *    }
     *
     *    g_list_free (transition_assets);
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ## ID
     *
     * Each asset is uniquely defined in the cache by its
     * #GESAsset:extractable-type and #GESAsset:id. Depending on the
     * #GESAsset:extractable-type, the #GESAsset:id can be used to parametrise
     * the creation of the object upon extraction. By default, a class that
     * implements #GESExtractable will only have a single associated asset,
     * with an #GESAsset:id set to the type name of its objects. However, this
     * is overwritten by some implementations, which allow a class to have
     * multiple associated assets. For example, for #GESTransitionClip the
     * #GESAsset:id will be a nickname of the #GESTransitionClip:vtype. You
     * should check the documentation for each extractable type to see if they
     * differ from the default.
     *
     * Moreover, each #GESAsset:extractable-type may also associate itself
     * with a specific asset subclass. In such cases, when their asset is
     * requested, an asset of this subclass will be returned instead.
     *
     * ## Managing
     *
     * You can use a #GESProject to easily manage the assets of a
     * #GESTimeline.
     *
     * ## Proxies
     *
     * Some assets can (temporarily) act as the #GESAsset:proxy of another
     * asset. When the original asset is requested from the cache, the proxy
     * will be returned in its place. This can be useful if, say, you want
     * to substitute a #GESUriClipAsset corresponding to a high resolution
     * media file with the asset of a lower resolution stand in.
     *
     * An asset may even have several proxies, the first of which will act as
     * its default and be returned on requests, but the others will be ordered
     * to take its place once it is removed. You can add a proxy to an asset,
     * or set its default, using ges_asset_set_proxy(), and you can remove
     * them with ges_asset_unproxy().

     * A #GESBaseEffect is some operation that applies an effect to the data

     *
     * ## Time Effects
     *
     * Some operations will change the timing of the stream data they receive
     * in some way. In particular, the #GstElement that they wrap could alter
     * the times of the segment they receive in a #GST_EVENT_SEGMENT event,
     * or the times of a seek they receive in a #GST_EVENT_SEEK event. Such
     * operations would be considered time effects since they translate the
     * times they receive on their source to different times at their sink,
     * and vis versa. This introduces two sets of time coordinates for the
     * event: (internal) sink coordinates and (internal) source coordinates,
     * where segment times are translated from the sink coordinates to the
     * source coordinates, and seek times are translated from the source
     * coordinates to the sink coordinates.
     *
     * If you use such an effect in GES, you will need to inform GES of the
     * properties that control the timing with
     * ges_base_effect_register_time_property(), and the effect's timing
     * behaviour using ges_base_effect_set_time_translation_funcs().
     *
     * Note that a time effect should not have its
     * #GESTrackElement:has-internal-source set to %TRUE.
     *
     * In addition, note that GES only *fully* supports time effects whose
     * mapping from the source to sink coordinates (those applied to seeks)
     * obeys:
     *
     * + Maps the time `0` to `0`. So initial time-shifting effects are
     *   excluded.
     * + Is monotonically increasing. So reversing effects, and effects that
     *   jump backwards in the stream are excluded.
     * + Can handle a reasonable #GstClockTime, relative to the project. So
     *   this would exclude a time effect with an extremely large speed-up
     *   that would cause the converted #GstClockTime seeks to overflow.

    /**
     * #GESClip-s are the core objects of a #GESLayer. Each clip may exist in
     * a single layer but may control several #GESTrackElement-s that span
     * several #GESTrack-s. A clip will ensure that all its children share the
     * same #GESTimelineElement:start and #GESTimelineElement:duration in
     * their tracks, which will match the #GESTimelineElement:start and
     * #GESTimelineElement:duration of the clip itself. Therefore, changing
     * the timing of the clip will change the timing of the children, and a
     * change in the timing of a child will change the timing of the clip and
     * subsequently all its siblings. As such, a clip can be treated as a
     * singular object in its layer.
     *
     * For most uses of a #GESTimeline, it is often sufficient to only
     * interact with #GESClip-s directly, which will take care of creating and
     * organising the elements of the timeline's tracks.
     *
     * ## Core Children
     *
     * In more detail, clips will usually have some *core* #GESTrackElement
     * children, which are created by the clip when it is added to a layer in
     * a timeline. The type and form of these core children will depend on the
     * clip's subclass. You can use ges_track_element_is_core() to determine
     * whether a track element is considered such a core track element. Note,
     * if a core track element is part of a clip, it will always be treated as
     * a core *child* of the clip. You can connect to the
     * #GESContainer::child-added signal to be notified of their creation.
     *
     * When a child is added to a clip, the timeline will select its tracks
     * using #GESTimeline::select-tracks-for-object. Note that it may be the
     * case that the child will still have no set #GESTrackElement:track
     * after this process. For example, if the timeline does not have a track
     * of the corresponding #GESTrack:track-type. A clip can safely contain
     * such children, which may have their track set later, although they will
     * play no functioning role in the timeline in the meantime.
     *
     * If a clip may create track elements with various
     * #GESTrackElement:track-type(s), such as a #GESUriClip, but you only
     * want it to create a subset of these types, you should set the
     * #GESClip:supported-formats of the clip to the subset of types. This
     * should be done *before* adding the clip to a layer.
     *
     * If a clip will produce several core elements of the same
     * #GESTrackElement:track-type, you should connect to the timeline's
     * #GESTimeline::select-tracks-for-object signal to coordinate which
     * tracks each element should land in. Note, no two core children within a
     * clip can share the same #GESTrack, so you should not select the same
     * track for two separate core children. Provided you stick to this rule,
     * it is still safe to select several tracks for the same core child, the
     * core child will be copied into the additional tracks. You can manually
     * add the child to more tracks later using ges_clip_add_child_to_track().
     * If you do not wish to use a core child, you can always select no track.
     *
     * The #GESTimelineElement:in-point of the clip will control the
     * #GESTimelineElement:in-point of its core children to be the same
     * value if their #GESTrackElement:has-internal-source is set to %TRUE.
     *
     * The #GESTimelineElement:max-duration of the clip is the minimum
     * #GESTimelineElement:max-duration of its core children. If you set its
     * value to anything other than its current value, this will also set the
     * #GESTimelineElement:max-duration of all its core children to the same
     * value if their #GESTrackElement:has-internal-source is set to %TRUE.
     * As a special case, whilst a clip does not yet have any core children,
     * its #GESTimelineElement:max-duration may be set to indicate what its
     * value will be once they are created.
     *
     * ## Effects
     *
     * Some subclasses (#GESSourceClip and #GESBaseEffectClip) may also allow
     * their objects to have additional non-core #GESBaseEffect-s elements as
     * children. These are additional effects that are applied to the output
     * data of the core elements. They can be added to the clip using
     * ges_clip_add_top_effect(), which will take care of adding the effect to
     * the timeline's tracks. The new effect will be placed between the clip's
     * core track elements and its other effects. As such, the newly added
     * effect will be applied to any source data **before** the other existing
     * effects. You can change the ordering of effects using
     * ges_clip_set_top_effect_index().
     *
     * Tracks are selected for top effects in the same way as core children.
     * If you add a top effect to a clip before it is part of a timeline, and
     * later add the clip to a timeline, the track selection for the top
     * effects will occur just after the track selection for the core
     * children. If you add a top effect to a clip that is already part of a
     * timeline, the track selection will occur immediately. Since a top
     * effect must be applied on top of a core child, if you use
     * #GESTimeline::select-tracks-for-object, you should ensure that the
     * added effects are destined for a #GESTrack that already contains a core
     * child.
     *
     * In addition, if the core child in the track is not
     * #GESTrackElement:active, then neither can any of its effects be
     * #GESTrackElement:active. Therefore, if a core child is made in-active,
     * all of the additional effects in the same track will also become
     * in-active. Similarly, if an effect is set to be active, then the core
     * child will also become active, but other effects will be left alone.
     * Finally, if an active effect is added to the track of an in-active core
     * child, it will become in-active as well. Note, in contrast, setting a
     * core child to be active, or an effect to be in-active will *not* change
     * the other children in the same track.
     *
     * ### Time Effects
     *
     * Some effects also change the timing of their data (see #GESBaseEffect
     * for what counts as a time effect). Note that a #GESBaseEffectClip will
     * refuse time effects, but a #GESSource will allow them.
     *
     * When added to a clip, time effects may adjust the timing of other
     * children in the same track. Similarly, when changing the order of
     * effects, making them (in)-active, setting their time property values
     * or removing time effects. These can cause the #GESClip:duration-limit
     * to change in value. However, if such an operation would ever cause the
     * #GESTimelineElement:duration to shrink such that a clip's #GESSource is
     * totally overlapped in the timeline, the operation would be prevented.
     * Note that the same can happen when adding non-time effects with a
     * finite #GESTimelineElement:max-duration.
     *
     * Therefore, when working with time effects, you should -- more so than
     * usual -- not assume that setting the properties of the clip's children
     * will succeed. In particular, you should use
     * ges_timeline_element_set_child_property_full() when setting the time
     * properties.
     *
     * If you wish to preserve the *internal* duration of a source in a clip
     * during these time effect operations, you can do something like the
     * following.
     *
     * ```c
     * void
     * do_time_effect_change (GESClip * clip)
     * {
     *   GList *tmp, *children;
     *   GESTrackElement *source;
     *   GstClockTime source_outpoint;
     *   GstClockTime new_end;

     *   source_outpoint = ges_clip_get_internal_time_from_timeline_time (
     *         clip, source, GES_TIMELINE_ELEMENT_END (clip), NULL);

     *   // handle invalid out-point
     *
     *   // stop the children's control sources from clamping when their
     *   // out-point changes with a change in the time effects
     *   children = ges_container_get_children (GES_CONTAINER (clip), FALSE);

     *
     *   // add time effect, or set their children properties, or move them around
     *   ...
     *   // user can make sure that if a time effect changes one source, we should
     *   // also change the time effect for another source. E.g. if
     *   // "GstVideorate::rate" is set to 2.0, we also set "GstPitch::rate" to
     *   // 2.0
     *
     *   // Note the duration of the clip may have already changed if the
     *   // duration-limit of the clip dropped below its current value
     *
     *   new_end = ges_clip_get_timeline_time_from_internal_time (
     *         clip, source, source_outpoint, &error);
     *   // handle error
     *
     *   if (!ges_timeline_elemnet_edit_full (GES_TIMELINE_ELEMENT (clip),
     *         -1, GES_EDIT_MODE_TRIM, GES_EDGE_END, new_end, &error))
     *     // handle error
     *
     *   for (tmp = children; tmp; tmp = tmp->next)
     *     ges_track_element_set_auto_clamp_control_sources (tmp->data, TRUE);
     *
     *   g_list_free_full (children, gst_object_unref);
     *   gst_object_unref (source);
     * }

     * the subproject in a timeline, you should use a #GESUriClip with the
     * same subproject URI.
     *
     * When loading a project with subproject, subprojects URIs will be temporary
     * writable local files. If you want to edit the subproject timeline,
     * you should retrieve the subproject from the parent project asset list and
     * extract the timeline with ges_asset_extract() and save it at
     * the same temporary location.

    /**
     * #GESTimeline is the central object for any multimedia timeline.
     *
     * A timeline is composed of a set of #GESTrack-s and a set of
     * #GESLayer-s, which are added to the timeline using
     * ges_timeline_add_track() and ges_timeline_append_layer(), respectively.
     *
     * The contained tracks define the supported types of the timeline
     * and provide the media output. Essentially, each track provides an
     * additional source #GstPad.
     *
     * Most usage of a timeline will likely only need a single #GESAudioTrack
     * and/or a single #GESVideoTrack. You can create such a timeline with
     * ges_timeline_new_audio_video(). After this, you are unlikely to need to
     * work with the tracks directly.
     *
     * A timeline's layers contain #GESClip-s, which in turn control the
     * creation of #GESTrackElement-s, which are added to the timeline's
     * tracks. See #GESTimeline::select-tracks-for-object if you wish to have
     * more control over which track a clip's elements are added to.
     *
     * The layers are ordered, with higher priority layers having their
     * content prioritised in the tracks. This ordering can be changed using
     * ges_timeline_move_layer().
     *
     * ## Editing
     *
     * See #GESTimelineElement for the various ways the elements of a timeline
     * can be edited.
     *
     * If you change the timing or ordering of a timeline's
     * #GESTimelineElement-s, then these changes will not actually be taken
     * into account in the output of the timeline's tracks until the
     * ges_timeline_commit() method is called. This allows you to move its
     * elements around, say, in response to an end user's mouse dragging, with
     * little expense before finalising their effect on the produced data.
     *
     * ## Overlaps and Auto-Transitions
     *
     * There are certain restrictions placed on how #GESSource-s may overlap
     * in a #GESTrack that belongs to a timeline. These will be enforced by
     * GES, so the user will not need to keep track of them, but they should
     * be aware that certain edits will be refused as a result if the overlap
     * rules would be broken.
     *
     * Consider two #GESSource-s, `A` and `B`, with start times `startA` and
     * `startB`, and end times `endA` and `endB`, respectively. The start
     * time refers to their #GESTimelineElement:start, and the end time is
     * their #GESTimelineElement:start + #GESTimelineElement:duration. These
     * two sources *overlap* if:
     *
     * + they share the same #GESTrackElement:track (non %NULL), which belongs
     *   to the timeline;
     * + they share the same #GES_TIMELINE_ELEMENT_LAYER_PRIORITY; and
     * + `startA < endB` and `startB < endA `.
     *
     * Note that when `startA = endB` or `startB = endA` then the two sources
     * will *touch* at their edges, but are not considered overlapping.
     *
     * If, in addition, `startA < startB < endA`, then we can say that the
     * end of `A` overlaps the start of `B`.
     *
     * If, instead, `startA <= startB` and `endA >= endB`, then we can say
     * that `A` fully overlaps `B`.
     *
     * The overlap rules for a timeline are that:
     *
     * 1. One source cannot fully overlap another source.
     * 2. A source can only overlap the end of up to one other source at its
     *    start.
     * 3. A source can only overlap the start of up to one other source at its
     *    end.
     *
     * The last two rules combined essentially mean that at any given timeline
     * position, only up to two #GESSource-s may overlap at that position. So
     * triple or more overlaps are not allowed.
     *
     * If you switch on #GESTimeline:auto-transition, then at any moment when
     * the end of one source (the first source) overlaps the start of another
     * (the second source), a #GESTransitionClip will be automatically created
     * for the pair in the same layer and it will cover their overlap. If the
     * two elements are edited in a way such that the end of the first source
     * no longer overlaps the start of the second, the transition will be
     * automatically removed from the timeline. However, if the two sources
     * still overlap at the same edges after the edit, then the same
     * transition object will be kept, but with its timing and layer adjusted
     * accordingly.
     *
     * NOTE: if you know what you are doing and want to be in full control of the
     * timeline layout, you can disable the edit APIs with
     * #ges_timeline_disable_edit_apis.
     *
     * ## Saving
     *
     * To save/load a timeline, you can use the ges_timeline_load_from_uri()
     * and ges_timeline_save_to_uri() methods that use the default format.
     *
     * ## Playing
     *
     * A timeline is a #GstBin with a source #GstPad for each of its
     * tracks, which you can fetch with ges_timeline_get_pad_for_track(). You
     * will likely want to link these to some compatible sink #GstElement-s to
     * be able to play or capture the content of the timeline.
     *
     * You can use a #GESPipeline to easily preview/play the timeline's
     * content, or render it to a file.

    /**
     * A #GESTimelineElement will have some temporal extent in its
     * corresponding #GESTimelineElement:timeline, controlled by its
     * #GESTimelineElement:start and #GESTimelineElement:duration. This
     * determines when its content will be displayed, or its effect applied,
     * in the timeline. Several objects may overlap within a given
     * #GESTimeline, in which case their #GESTimelineElement:priority is used
     * to determine their ordering in the timeline. Priority is mostly handled
     * internally by #GESLayer-s and #GESClip-s.
     *
     * A timeline element can have a #GESTimelineElement:parent,
     * such as a #GESClip, which is responsible for controlling its timing.
     *
     * ## Editing
     *
     * Elements can be moved around in their #GESTimelineElement:timeline by
     * setting their #GESTimelineElement:start and
     * #GESTimelineElement:duration using ges_timeline_element_set_start()
     * and ges_timeline_element_set_duration(). Additionally, which parts of
     * the underlying content are played in the timeline can be adjusted by
     * setting the #GESTimelineElement:in-point using
     * ges_timeline_element_set_inpoint(). The library also provides
     * ges_timeline_element_edit(), with various #GESEditMode-s, which can
     * adjust these properties in a convenient way, as well as introduce
     * similar changes in neighbouring or later elements in the timeline.
     *
     * However, a timeline may refuse a change in these properties if they
     * would place the timeline in an unsupported configuration. See
     * #GESTimeline for its overlap rules.
     *
     * Additionally, an edit may be refused if it would place one of the
     * timing properties out of bounds (such as a negative time value for
     * #GESTimelineElement:start, or having insufficient internal
     * content to last for the desired #GESTimelineElement:duration).
     *
     * ## Time Coordinates
     *
     * There are three main sets of time coordinates to consider when using
     * timeline elements:
     *
     * + Timeline coordinates: these are the time coordinates used in the
     *   output of the timeline in its #GESTrack-s. Each track share the same
     *   coordinates, so there is only one set of coordinates for the
     *   timeline. These extend indefinitely from 0. The times used for
     *   editing (including setting #GESTimelineElement:start and
     *   #GESTimelineElement:duration) use these coordinates, since these
     *   define when an element is present and for how long the element lasts
     *   for in the timeline.
     * + Internal source coordinates: these are the time coordinates used
     *   internally at the element's output. This is only really defined for
     *   #GESTrackElement-s, where it refers to time coordinates used at the
     *   final source pad of the wrapped #GstElement-s. However, these
     *   coordinates may also be used in a #GESClip in reference to its
     *   children. In particular, these are the coordinates used for
     *   #GESTimelineElement:in-point and #GESTimelineElement:max-duration.
     * + Internal sink coordinates: these are the time coordinates used
     *   internally at the element's input. A #GESSource has no input, so
     *   these would be undefined. Otherwise, for most #GESTrackElement-s
     *   these will be the same set of coordinates as the internal source
     *   coordinates because the element does not change the timing
     *   internally. Only #GESBaseEffect can support elements where these
     *   are different. See #GESBaseEffect for more information.
     *
     * You can determine the timeline time for a given internal source time
     * in a #GESTrack in a #GESClip using
     * ges_clip_get_timeline_time_from_internal_time(), and vice versa using
     * ges_clip_get_internal_time_from_timeline_time(), for the purposes of
     * editing and setting timings properties.
     *
     * ## Children Properties
     *
     * If a timeline element owns another #GstObject and wishes to expose
     * some of its properties, it can do so by registering the property as one
     * of the timeline element's children properties using
     * ges_timeline_element_add_child_property(). The registered property of
     * the child can then be read and set using the
     * ges_timeline_element_get_child_property() and
     * ges_timeline_element_set_child_property() methods, respectively. Some
     * sub-classed objects will be created with pre-registered children
     * properties; for example, to expose part of an underlying #GstElement
     * that is used internally. The registered properties can be listed with
     * ges_timeline_element_list_children_properties().

     * A #GESTrackElement is a #GESTimelineElement that specifically belongs
     * to a single #GESTrack of its #GESTimelineElement:timeline. Its
     * #GESTimelineElement:start and #GESTimelineElement:duration specify its
     * temporal extent in the track. Specifically, a track element wraps some
     * nleobject, such as an #nlesource or #nleoperation, which can be
     * retrieved with ges_track_element_get_nleobject(), and its
     * #GESTimelineElement:start, #GESTimelineElement:duration,
     * #GESTimelineElement:in-point, #GESTimelineElement:priority and
     * #GESTrackElement:active properties expose the corresponding nleobject
     * properties. When a track element is added to a track, its nleobject is
     * added to the corresponding #nlecomposition that the track wraps.
     *
     * Most users will not have to work directly with track elements since a
     * #GESClip will automatically create track elements for its timeline's
     * tracks and take responsibility for updating them. The only track
     * elements that are not automatically created by clips, but a user is
     * likely to want to create, are #GESEffect-s.
     *
     * ## Control Bindings for Children Properties
     *
     * You can set up control bindings for a track element child property
     * using ges_track_element_set_control_source(). A
     * #GstTimedValueControlSource should specify the timed values using the
     * internal source coordinates (see #GESTimelineElement). By default,
     * these will be updated to lie between the #GESTimelineElement:in-point
     * and out-point of the element. This can be switched off by setting
     * #GESTrackElement:auto-clamp-control-sources to %FALSE.
