         * Starts asynchronous initialization of the object implementing the
         * interface. This must be done before any real use of the object after
         * initial construction. If the object also implements #GInitable you can
         * optionally call g_initable_init() instead.
         *
         * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
         * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
         *
         * When the initialization is finished, `callback` will be called. You can
         * then call g_async_initable_init_finish() to get the result of the
         * initialization.
         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
         * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
         * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL, and
         * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
         *
         * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
         * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
         * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
         * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
         * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
         * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times,
         * implementation requires yielding all subsequent calls to init_async() on the
         * results of the first call.
         *
         * For classes that also support the #GInitable interface, the default
         * implementation of this method will run the g_initable_init() function
         * in a thread, so if you want to support asynchronous initialization via
         * threads, just implement the #GAsyncInitable interface without overriding
         * any interface methods.
         * @param io_priority the [I/O priority][io-priority] of the operation
