 * <![CDATA[         Values of this enumeration indicate the extent to which metadata           such as aliases and group memberships can be stored for the contacts           on a particular connection.          On some protocols, certain metadata (for instance, contact aliases)           can only be stored for contacts on the contact list, or contacts           with a particular contact list state.          To make it easier to deal with such protocols, if clients set           metadata on a contact who is not in the required state, the           Connection MUST cache the metadata for the duration of the session.           If clients request the attributes of that contact after the           appropriate "set" method has returned successfully, the Connection           MUST return the new (cached) value.          If the contact is later placed in the required state to store           metadata (for instance, if subscription to the contact's presence           is requested, on a protocol like MSN where the alias has storage type           Subscribed_Or_Pending), the connection MUST store the cached           metadata at that time.                     If the Connection didn't cache changes in this way, a client             intending to change the alias on MSN would have to wait until             the server acknowledged the subscription request; in the meantime,             other clients would still display the old alias.                   The only exception to that general rule is that if the Connection           cannot store particular metadata at all (i.e. the           storage type is None), it MUST reject attempts to set it.                     If the implementation knows that metadata can't be stored at             all, it's useful to report that, which can be done             synchronously. In general, user interfaces should detect             storage type None and not display editing controls at all.                ]]>

Exactly how this is achieved varies by             channel type.            For StreamTube channels, this access control type             may only be used on UNIX sockets.             The connecting process must send a byte when             it first connects, which is not considered to be part of the data             stream. If the operating system uses sendmsg() with SCM_CREDS or             SCM_CREDENTIALS to pass credentials over sockets, the connecting             process must do so if possible; if not, it must still send the             byte, without any attached credentials. (This mechanism is             very similar to the first byte of a D-Bus connection, except that             in D-Bus the byte is always zero, whereas in Tubes it can be             nonzero.)            For DBusTube channels, this access control type             may be used on any type of socket, and there is no extra byte             added by Telepathy at the beginning of the stream: all bytes in             the stream are part of the D-Bus tube connection. The connecting             process should prove its identity via any of the SASL             authentication mechanisms usually used for D-Bus (in typical             D-Bus implementations this involves either sending and receiving             credentials as above, or demonstrating the ability to write to a             file in the user's home directory).            In either case, the listening process will disconnect the             connection unless it can determine by OS-specific means that             the connecting process has the same user ID as the listening             process.            In either tube type, the associated variant must be ignored.         ]]>

The existence               of this flag allows loggers and UIs to use better heuristics               when eliminating duplicates (a simple implementation made               possible by this flag would be to avoid logging scrollback               at all).                    ]]>

     * 
     * Some channels (those with flags that include
     * %TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_CHANNEL_SPECIFIC_HANDLES) have a concept of
     * "channel-specific contacts". These are contacts that only have meaning within
     * the context of the channel - for instance, in XMPP Multi-User Chat,
     * participants in a chatroom are identified by an in-room JID consisting
     * of the JID of the chatroom plus a local nickname.
     * 
     * Depending on the protocol and configuration, it might be possible to find
     * out what globally valid contact (i.e. a contact that you could add to
     * your contact list) "owns" a channel-specific contact. For instance, in
     * most XMPP MUC chatrooms, normal users cannot see what global JID
     * corresponds to an in-room JID, but moderators can.
     * 
     * This is further complicated by the fact that channels with channel-specific
     * contacts can sometimes have members with globally valid contacts (for
     * instance, if you invite someone to an XMPP MUC using their globally valid

     * - if %TP_CHANNEL_FEATURE_GROUP has not yet been prepared, result is
     *   undefined;
     * - if `self` does not have flags that include
     *   %TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_PROPERTIES,
     *   result is undefined;
     * - if `handle` is channel-specific and its globally valid "owner" is known,
     *   return that owner;
     * - if `handle` is channel-specific and its globally valid "owner" is unknown,
     *   return zero;
     * - if `handle` is globally valid, return `handle` itself
     * 
     * Some channels (those with flags that include
     * %TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_CHANNEL_SPECIFIC_HANDLES) have a concept of
     * "channel-specific handles". These are handles that only have meaning within
     * the context of the channel - for instance, in XMPP Multi-User Chat,
     * participants in a chatroom are identified by an in-room JID consisting
     * of the JID of the chatroom plus a local nickname.
     * 
     * Depending on the protocol and configuration, it might be possible to find
     * out what globally valid handle (i.e. an identifier that you could add to
     * your contact list) "owns" a channel-specific handle. For instance, in
     * most XMPP MUC chatrooms, normal users cannot see what global JID
     * corresponds to an in-room JID, but moderators can.
     * 
     * This is further complicated by the fact that channels with channel-specific
     * handles can sometimes have members with globally valid handles (for
     * instance, if you invite someone to an XMPP MUC using their globally valid
     * JID, you would expect to see the handle representing that JID in the
     * Group's remote-pending set).
     * 
     * This function's result is undefined unless the channel is ready
     * and its flags include %TP_CHANNEL_GROUP_FLAG_PROPERTIES (an implementation
     * without extra D-Bus round trips is not possible using the older API).

/**
 * One of the channel dispatcher's functions is to offer incoming channels to
 * Approver clients for approval. An approver should generally ask the user
 * whether they want to participate in the requested communication channels
 * (join the chat or chatroom, answer the call, accept the file transfer, or
 * whatever is appropriate). A collection of channels offered in this way
 * is represented by a ChannelDispatchOperation object.
 * 
 * If the user wishes to accept the communication channels, the approver
 * should call tp_cli_channel_dispatch_operation_call_handle_with() to
 * indicate the user's or approver's preferred handler for the channels (the
 * empty string indicates no particular preference, and will cause any
 * suitable handler to be used).
 * 
 * If the user wishes to reject the communication channels, or if the user
 * accepts the channels and the approver will handle them itself, the approver
 * should call tp_cli_channel_dispatch_operation_call_claim(). If this method
 * succeeds, the approver immediately has control over the channels as their
 * primary handler, and may do anything with them (in particular, it may close
 * them in whatever way seems most appropriate).
 * 
 * There are various situations in which the channel dispatch operation will
 * be closed, causing the #TpProxy::invalidated signal to be emitted. If this
 * happens, the approver should stop prompting the user.

/**
 * An object representing a contact on a #TpConnection.
 * 
 * Contact objects support tracking a number of attributes of contacts, as
 * described by the #TpContactFeature flags. Features can be specified when
 * instantiating contact objects (with tp_connection_get_contacts_by_id() or
 * tp_connection_get_contacts_by_handle()), or added to an existing contact
 * object with tp_connection_upgrade_contacts(). For example, a client wishing
 * to keep track of a contact's alias would set #TP_CONTACT_FEATURE_ALIAS, and
 * then listen for the "notify::alias" signal, emitted whenever the
 * #TpContact:alias property changes.
 * 
 * Note that releasing a #TpContact object might release handle references
 * held by calling tp_cli_connection_call_request_handles(),
 * tp_cli_connection_run_request_handles(),
 * tp_cli_connection_call_hold_handles(),
 * tp_cli_connection_run_hold_handles(),
 * tp_cli_connection_interface_contacts_call_get_contact_attributes() or
 * tp_cli_connection_interface_contacts_run_get_contact_attributes() directly.
 * Those functions should be avoided in favour of using #TpContact,
 * tp_connection_hold_handles(), tp_connection_request_handles() and
 * tp_connection_get_contact_attributes().
