         *

         * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
         * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
         * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
         * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.

         * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
         * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
         * behaviour. See the [description][iface`Gio`.Initable#description] for more details.

         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
         * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
         * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
         * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
         * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
         * instance.
