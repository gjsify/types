         * Complete version of g_object_bind_property().
         *
         * Creates a binding between `source_property` on `source` and `target_property`
         * on `target,` allowing you to set the transformation functions to be used by
         * the binding.
         *
         * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
         * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
         * will be updated as well. The `transform_from` function is only used in case
         * of bidirectional bindings, otherwise it will be ignored
         *
         * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
         * `target` instances are finalized. This will release the reference that is
         * being held on the #GBinding instance; if you want to hold on to the
         * #GBinding instance, you will need to hold a reference to it.
         *
         * To remove the binding, call g_binding_unbind().
         *
         * A #GObject can have multiple bindings.
         *
         * The same `user_data` parameter will be used for both `transform_to`
         * and `transform_from` transformation functions; the `notify` function will
         * be called once, when the binding is removed. If you need different data
         * for each transformation function, please use
         * g_object_bind_property_with_closures() instead.
