     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_POINT_SIZE`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the point size
     * calculation step within the vertex shader stage. The snippet should
     * write to the builtin cogl_point_size_out with the new point size.
     * The snippet can either read cogl_point_size_in directly and write a

     * that would be set by a previous snippet. Note that this hook is
     * only used if cogl_pipeline_set_per_vertex_point_size() is enabled
     * on the pipeline.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,

     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just before

     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_FRAGMENT`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the fragment processing

     * this variable.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_TEXTURE_COORD_TRANSFORM`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the texture coordinate
     * transformation of a particular layer. This can be used to replace
     * the processing for a layer or to modify the results.
     *
     * Within the snippet code for this hook there are two extra
     * variables. The first is a mat4 called cogl_matrix which represents
     * the user matrix for this layer. The second is called cogl_tex_coord
     * and represents the incoming and outgoing texture coordinate. On
     * entry to the hook, cogl_tex_coord contains the value of the
     * corresponding texture coordinate attribute for this layer. The hook
     * is expected to modify this variable. The output will be passed as a
     * varying to the fragment processing stage. The default code will
     * just multiply cogl_matrix by cogl_tex_coord and store the result in
     * cogl_tex_coord.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just before the
     * fragment processing for this layer. At this point cogl_tex_coord
     * still contains the value of the texture coordinate attribute.
     * If a ‘replace’ string is given then this will be used instead of
     * the default fragment processing for this layer. The snippet can
     * modify cogl_tex_coord or leave it as is to apply no transformation.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just after the
     * transformation. At this point cogl_tex_coord will contain the
     * results of the transformation but it can be further modified by the
     * snippet.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_LAYER_FRAGMENT`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the fragment processing
     * of a particular layer. This can be used to replace the processing
     * for a layer or to modify the results.
     *
     * Within the snippet code for this hook there is an extra vec4
     * variable called ‘cogl_layer’. This contains the resulting color
     * that will be used for the layer. This can be modified in the ‘post’
     * section or it the default processing can be replaced entirely using
     * the ‘replace’ section.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just before the
     * fragment processing for this layer.
     *
     * If a ‘replace’ string is given then this will be used instead of
     * the default fragment processing for this layer. The snippet must write to
     * the ‘cogl_layer’ variable in that case.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just after the
     * fragment processing for the layer. The results can be modified by changing
     * the value of the ‘cogl_layer’ variable.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_TEXTURE_LOOKUP`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the texture lookup part
     * of a given layer. This gives a chance for the application to modify
     * the coordinates that will be used for the texture lookup or to
     * alter the returned texel.
     *
     * Within the snippet code for this hook there are three extra
     * variables available. ‘cogl_sampler’ is a sampler object
     * representing the sampler for the layer where the snippet is
     * attached. ‘cogl_tex_coord’ is a vec4 which contains the texture
     * coordinates that will be used for the texture lookup. This can be
     * modified. ‘cogl_texel’ will contain the result of the texture
     * lookup. This can also be modified.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted at the top of the
     * main() function before any fragment processing is done. This is a
     * good place to modify the cogl_tex_coord variable.
     *
     * If a ‘replace’ string is given then this will be used instead of a
     * the default texture lookup. The snippet would typically use its own
     * sampler in this case.
     *

     * is attached to a pipeline.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_VERTEX_GLOBALS`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet at the beginning of the global section of the
     * shader for the vertex processing. Any declarations here can be
     * shared with all other snippets that are attached to a vertex hook.
     * Only the ‘declarations’ string is used and the other strings are
     * ignored.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_FRAGMENT_GLOBALS`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet at the beginning of the global section of the
     * shader for the fragment processing. Any declarations here can be
     * shared with all other snippets that are attached to a fragment
     * hook. Only the ‘declarations’ string is used and the other strings
     * are ignored.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_VERTEX`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the vertex processing
     * stage of the pipeline. This gives a chance for the application to
     * modify the vertex attributes generated by the shader. Typically the
     * snippet will modify cogl_color_out or cogl_position_out builtins.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted at the top of the
     * main() function before any vertex processing is done.
     *
     * The ‘replace’ string in `snippet` will be used instead of the
     * generated vertex processing if it is present. This can be used if
     * the application wants to provide a complete vertex shader and
     * doesn't need the generated output from Cogl.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted after all of the
     * standard vertex processing is done. This can be used to modify the
     * outputs.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_VERTEX_TRANSFORM`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the vertex transform stage.
     * Typically the snippet will use the cogl_modelview_matrix,
     * cogl_projection_matrix and cogl_modelview_projection_matrix matrices and the
     * cogl_position_in attribute. The hook must write to cogl_position_out.
     * The default processing for this hook will multiply cogl_position_in by
     * the combined modelview-projection matrix and store it on cogl_position_out.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted at the top of the
     * main() function before the vertex transform is done.
     *
     * The ‘replace’ string in `snippet` will be used instead of the
     * generated vertex transform if it is present.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted after all of the
     * standard vertex transformation is done. This can be used to modify the
     * cogl_position_out in addition to the default processing.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_POINT_SIZE`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the point size
     * calculation step within the vertex shader stage. The snippet should
     * write to the builtin cogl_point_size_out with the new point size.
     * The snippet can either read cogl_point_size_in directly and write a
     * new value or first read an existing value in cogl_point_size_out
     * that would be set by a previous snippet. Note that this hook is
     * only used if cogl_pipeline_set_per_vertex_point_size() is enabled
     * on the pipeline.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just before
     * calculating the point size.
     *
     * The ‘replace’ string in `snippet` will be used instead of the
     * generated point size calculation if it is present.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted after the
     * standard point size calculation is done. This can be used to modify
     * cogl_point_size_out in addition to the default processing.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_FRAGMENT`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the fragment processing
     * stage of the pipeline. This gives a chance for the application to
     * modify the fragment color generated by the shader. Typically the
     * snippet will modify cogl_color_out.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted at the top of the
     * main() function before any fragment processing is done.
     *
     * The ‘replace’ string in `snippet` will be used instead of the
     * generated fragment processing if it is present. This can be used if
     * the application wants to provide a complete fragment shader and
     * doesn't need the generated output from Cogl.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted after all of the
     * standard fragment processing is done. At this point the generated
     * value for the rest of the pipeline state will already be in
     * cogl_color_out so the application can modify the result by altering
     * this variable.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_TEXTURE_COORD_TRANSFORM`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the texture coordinate
     * transformation of a particular layer. This can be used to replace
     * the processing for a layer or to modify the results.
     *
     * Within the snippet code for this hook there are two extra
     * variables. The first is a mat4 called cogl_matrix which represents
     * the user matrix for this layer. The second is called cogl_tex_coord
     * and represents the incoming and outgoing texture coordinate. On
     * entry to the hook, cogl_tex_coord contains the value of the
     * corresponding texture coordinate attribute for this layer. The hook
     * is expected to modify this variable. The output will be passed as a
     * varying to the fragment processing stage. The default code will
     * just multiply cogl_matrix by cogl_tex_coord and store the result in
     * cogl_tex_coord.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just before the
     * fragment processing for this layer. At this point cogl_tex_coord
     * still contains the value of the texture coordinate attribute.
     * If a ‘replace’ string is given then this will be used instead of
     * the default fragment processing for this layer. The snippet can
     * modify cogl_tex_coord or leave it as is to apply no transformation.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just after the
     * transformation. At this point cogl_tex_coord will contain the
     * results of the transformation but it can be further modified by the
     * snippet.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_LAYER_FRAGMENT`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the fragment processing
     * of a particular layer. This can be used to replace the processing
     * for a layer or to modify the results.
     *
     * Within the snippet code for this hook there is an extra vec4
     * variable called ‘cogl_layer’. This contains the resulting color
     * that will be used for the layer. This can be modified in the ‘post’
     * section or it the default processing can be replaced entirely using
     * the ‘replace’ section.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just before the
     * fragment processing for this layer.
     *
     * If a ‘replace’ string is given then this will be used instead of
     * the default fragment processing for this layer. The snippet must write to
     * the ‘cogl_layer’ variable in that case.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted just after the
     * fragment processing for the layer. The results can be modified by changing
     * the value of the ‘cogl_layer’ variable.
     *
     * - `COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_TEXTURE_LOOKUP`
     *
     * Adds a shader snippet that will hook on to the texture lookup part
     * of a given layer. This gives a chance for the application to modify
     * the coordinates that will be used for the texture lookup or to
     * alter the returned texel.
     *
     * Within the snippet code for this hook there are three extra
     * variables available. ‘cogl_sampler’ is a sampler object
     * representing the sampler for the layer where the snippet is
     * attached. ‘cogl_tex_coord’ is a vec4 which contains the texture
     * coordinates that will be used for the texture lookup. This can be
     * modified. ‘cogl_texel’ will contain the result of the texture
     * lookup. This can also be modified.
     *
     * The ‘declarations’ string in `snippet` will be inserted in the
     * global scope of the shader. Use this to declare any uniforms,
     * attributes or functions that the snippet requires.
     *
     * The ‘pre’ string in `snippet` will be inserted at the top of the
     * main() function before any fragment processing is done. This is a
     * good place to modify the cogl_tex_coord variable.
     *
     * If a ‘replace’ string is given then this will be used instead of a
     * the default texture lookup. The snippet would typically use its own
     * sampler in this case.
     *
     * The ‘post’ string in `snippet` will be inserted after texture lookup
     * has been performed. Here the snippet can modify the cogl_texel
     * variable to alter the returned texel.

     * The source and destination rectangles are defined in offscreen
     * framebuffer orientation. When copying between an offscreen and

     *
     * The two buffers must have the same value types (e.g. floating-point,

     * need to match. This limitation comes from OpenGL ES 3.0 definition
     * of glBlitFramebuffer.
     *
     * Note that this function differs a lot from the glBlitFramebuffer
     * function provided by the GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit extension. Notably
     * it doesn't support having different sizes for the source and
     * destination rectangle. This doesn't seem

     * function therefore ensure that an empty clip stack is flushed

     * ignored.
     *
     * The function also doesn't support specifying the buffers to copy
     * and instead only the color buffer is copied. When copying the depth
     * or stencil buffers the extension on GLES2.0 only supports copying
     * the full buffer which would be awkward to document with this

     * Common buffer functions, including data upload APIs
     *
     * The CoglBuffer API provides a common interface to manipulate
     * buffers that have been allocated either via `cogl_pixel_buffer_new()`
     * or `cogl_attribute_buffer_new()`. The API allows you to upload data
     * to these buffers and define usage hints that help Cogl manage your
     * buffer optimally.
     *
     * Data can either be uploaded by supplying a pointer and size so Cogl
     * can copy your data, or you can mmap() a CoglBuffer and then you can
     * copy data to the buffer directly.
     *
     * One of the most common uses for CoglBuffers is to upload texture
     * data asynchronously since the ability to mmap the buffers into
     * the CPU makes it possible for another thread to handle the IO
     * of loading an image file and unpacking it into the mapped buffer
     * without blocking other Cogl operations.

     * The top level application context.
     *
     * A #CoglContext is the top most sandbox of Cogl state for an
     * application or toolkit. Its main purpose is to act as a sandbox
     * for the memory management of state objects. Normally an application
     * will only create a single context since there is no way to share
     * resources between contexts.
     *
     * For those familiar with OpenGL or perhaps Cairo it should be
     * understood that unlike these APIs a Cogl context isn't a rendering
     * context as such. In other words Cogl doesn't aim to provide a state
     * machine style model for configuring rendering parameters. Most
     * rendering state in Cogl is directly associated with user managed
     * objects called pipelines and geometry is drawn with a specific
     * pipeline object to a framebuffer object and those 3 things fully
     * define the state for drawing. This is an important part of Cogl's
     * design since it helps you write orthogonal rendering components
     * that can all access the same GPU without having to worry about
     * what state other components have left you with.
     *
     * Cogl does not maintain internal references to the context for
     * resources that depend on the context so applications. This is to
     * help applications control the lifetime a context without us needing to
     * introduce special api to handle the breakup of internal circular
     * references due to internal resources and caches associated with the
     * context.
     *
     * One a context has been destroyed then all directly or indirectly
     * dependent resources will be in an inconsistent state and should not
     * be manipulated or queried in any way.
     *
     * For applications that rely on the operating system to clean up
     * resources this policy shouldn't affect them, but for applications
     * that need to carefully destroy and re-create Cogl contexts multiple
     * times throughout their lifetime (such as Android applications) they
     * should be careful to destroy all context dependent resources, such as
     * framebuffers or textures etc before unrefing and destroying the
     * context.

     * Describe vertex indices stored in a #CoglIndexBuffer.
     *
     * Indices allow you to avoid duplicating vertices in your vertex data
     * by virtualizing your data and instead providing a sequence of index
     * values that tell the GPU which data should be used for each vertex.
     *
     * If the GPU is given a sequence of indices it doesn't simply walk
     * through each vertex of your data in order it will instead walk
     * through the indices which can provide random access to the
     * underlying data.
     *
     * Since it's very common to have duplicate vertices when describing a
     * shape as a list of triangles it can often be a significant space
     * saving to describe geometry using indices. Reducing the size of
     * your models can make it cheaper to map them into the GPU by
     * reducing the demand on memory bandwidth and may help to make better
     * use of your GPUs internal vertex caching.
     *
     * For example, to describe a quadrilateral as 2 triangles for the GPU
     * you could either provide data with 6 vertices or instead with
     * indices you can provide vertex data for just 4 vertices and an
     * index buffer that specifies the 6 vertices by indexing the shared
     * vertices multiple times.
     *
     * ```c
     *   CoglVertexP2 quad_vertices[] = {
     *     {x0, y0}, //0 = top left
     *     {x1, y1}, //1 = bottom left
     *     {x2, y2}, //2 = bottom right
     *     {x3, y3}, //3 = top right
     *   };
     *   //tell the gpu how to interpret the quad as 2 triangles...
     *   unsigned char indices[] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3};
     * ```
     *
     * Even in the above illustration we see a saving of 10bytes for one
     * quad compared to having data for 6 vertices and no indices but if
     * you need to draw 100s or 1000s of quads then its really quite
     * significant.
     *
     * Something else to consider is that often indices can be defined
     * once and remain static while the vertex data may change for
     * animations perhaps. That means you may be able to ignore the
     * negligible cost of mapping your indices into the GPU if they don't
     * ever change.
     *
     * The above illustration is actually a good example of static indices
     * because it's really common that developers have quad mesh data that
     * they need to display and we know exactly what that indices array
     * needs to look like depending on the number of quads that need to be
     * drawn. It doesn't matter how the quads might be animated and
     * changed the indices will remain the same. Cogl even has a utility
     * (cogl_get_rectangle_indices()) to get access to re-useable indices
     * for drawing quads as above.

     * Functions for accessing the programmable GL pipeline
     *
     * Cogl allows accessing the GL programmable pipeline in order to create
     * vertex and fragment shaders.
     *
     * When using GLSL Cogl provides replacement names for most of the
     * builtin varyings and uniforms. It is recommended to use these names
     * wherever possible to increase portability between OpenGL 2.0 and
     * GLES 2.0. GLES 2.0 does not have most of the builtins under their
     * original names so they will only work with the Cogl names.
     *
     * For use in all GLSL shaders, the Cogl builtins are as follows:
     *
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_modelview_matrix`
     *    The current modelview matrix. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_ModelViewMatrix.
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_projection_matrix`
     *    The current projection matrix. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_ProjectionMatrix.
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_modelview_projection_matrix`
     *    The combined modelview and projection matrix. A vertex shader
     *    would typically use this to transform the incoming vertex
     *    position. The separate modelview and projection matrices are
     *    usually only needed for lighting calculations. This is
     *    equivalent to #gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix.
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_texture_matrix[]`
     *    An array of matrices for transforming the texture
     *    coordinates. This is equivalent to #gl_TextureMatrix.
     *
     * In a vertex shader, the following are also available:
     *
     * - `attribute vec4 cogl_position_in`
     *    The incoming vertex position. This is equivalent to #gl_Vertex.
     * - `attribute vec4 cogl_color_in`

    /**
     * Functions for creating and manipulating shader snippets
     *
     * `CoglSnippet`s are used to modify or replace parts of a
     * #CoglPipeline using GLSL. GLSL is a programming language supported
     * by OpenGL on programmable hardware to provide a more flexible
     * description of what should be rendered. A description of GLSL
     * itself is outside the scope of this documentation but any good
     * OpenGL book should help to describe it.
     *
     * Unlike in OpenGL, when using GLSL with Cogl it is possible to write
     * short snippets to replace small sections of the pipeline instead of
     * having to replace the whole of either the vertex or fragment
     * pipelines. Of course it is also possible to replace the whole of
     * the pipeline if needed.
     *
     * Each snippet is a standalone chunk of code which would attach to
     * the pipeline at a particular point. The code is split into four
     * separate strings (all of which are optional):
     *
     * - `declarations`
     * The code in this string will be inserted outside of any function in
     * the global scope of the shader. This can be used to declare
     * uniforms, attributes, varyings and functions to be used by the
     * snippet.
     * - `pre`
     * The code in this string will be inserted before the hook point.
     * - `post`
     * The code in this string will be inserted after the hook point. This
     * can be used to modify the results of the builtin generated code for
     * that hook point.
     * - `replace
     * If present the code in this string will replace the generated code
     * for the hook point.
     *
     * All of the strings apart from the declarations string of a pipeline
     * are generated in a single function so they can share variables
     * declared from one string in another. The scope of the code is
     * limited to each snippet so local variables declared in the snippet
     * will not collide with variables declared in another
     * snippet. However, code in the 'declarations' string is global to
     * the shader so it is the application's responsibility to ensure that
     * variables declared here will not collide with those from other
     * snippets.
     *
     * The snippets can be added to a pipeline with
     * cogl_pipeline_add_snippet() or
     * cogl_pipeline_add_layer_snippet(). Which function to use depends on
     * which hook the snippet is targeting. The snippets are all
     * generated in the order they are added to the pipeline. That is, the
     * post strings are executed in the order they are added to the
     * pipeline and the pre strings are executed in reverse order. If any
     * replace strings are given for a snippet then any other snippets
     * with the same hook added before that snippet will be ignored. The
     * different hooks are documented under #CoglSnippetHook.
     *
     * For portability with GLES2, it is recommended not to use the GLSL
     * builtin names such as gl_FragColor. Instead there are replacement
     * names under the cogl_* namespace which can be used instead. These
     * are:
     *
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_modelview_matrix
     *    The current modelview matrix. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_ModelViewMatrix.
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_projection_matrix
     *    The current projection matrix. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_ProjectionMatrix.
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_modelview_projection_matrix
     *    The combined modelview and projection matrix. A vertex shader
     *    would typically use this to transform the incoming vertex
     *    position. The separate modelview and projection matrices are
     *    usually only needed for lighting calculations. This is
     *    equivalent to #gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix.
     * - `uniform mat4 cogl_texture_matrix[]
     *    An array of matrices for transforming the texture
     *    coordinates. This is equivalent to #gl_TextureMatrix.
     *
     * In a vertex shader, the following are also available:
     *
     * - `attribute vec4 cogl_position_in
     *    The incoming vertex position. This is equivalent to #gl_Vertex.
     * - `attribute vec4 cogl_color_in`
     *    The incoming vertex color. This is equivalent to #gl_Color.
     * - `attribute vec4 cogl_tex_coord_in`
     *    The texture coordinate for layer 0. This is an alternative name
     *    for #cogl_tex_coord0_in.
     * - `attribute vec4 cogl_tex_coord0_in
     *    The texture coordinate for the layer 0. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_MultiTexCoord0. There will also be #cogl_tex_coord1_in and
     *    so on if more layers are added to the pipeline.
     * - `attribute vec3 cogl_normal_in`
     *    The normal of the vertex. This is equivalent to #gl_Normal.
     * - `vec4 cogl_position_out
     *    The calculated position of the vertex. This must be written to
     *    in all vertex shaders. This is equivalent to #gl_Position.
     * - `float cogl_point_size_in
     *    The incoming point size from the cogl_point_size_in attribute.
     *    This is only available if
     *    cogl_pipeline_set_per_vertex_point_size() is set on the
     *    pipeline.
     * - `float cogl_point_size_out`
     *    The calculated size of a point. This is equivalent to #gl_PointSize.
     * - `varying vec4 cogl_color_out`
     *    The calculated color of a vertex. This is equivalent to #gl_FrontColor.
     * - `varying vec4 cogl_tex_coord0_out`
     *    The calculated texture coordinate for layer 0 of the pipeline.
     *    This is equivalent to #gl_TexCoord[0]. There will also be
     *    #cogl_tex_coord1_out and so on if more layers are added to the
     *    pipeline. In the fragment shader, this varying is called
     *    #cogl_tex_coord0_in.
     *
     * In a fragment shader, the following are also available:
     *
     * - `varying vec4 cogl_color_in`
     *    The calculated color of a vertex. This is equivalent to #gl_FrontColor.
     * - `varying vec4 cogl_tex_coord0_in`
     *    The texture coordinate for layer 0. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_TexCoord[0]. There will also be #cogl_tex_coord1_in and so
     *    on if more layers are added to the pipeline.
     * - `vec4 cogl_color_out`
     *    The final calculated color of the fragment. All fragment shaders
     *    must write to this variable. This is equivalent to
     *    #gl_FrontColor.
     * - `float cogl_depth_out`
     *    An optional output variable specifying the depth value to use
     *    for this fragment. This is equivalent to #gl_FragDepth.
     * - `bool cogl_front_facing`
     *    A readonly variable that will be true if the current primitive
     *    is front facing. This can be used to implement two-sided
     *    coloring algorithms. This is equivalent to #gl_FrontFacing.
     * - `vec2 cogl_point_coord`
     *    When rendering points, this will contain a vec2 which represents
     *    the position within the point of the current fragment.
     *    vec2(0.0,0.0) will be the topleft of the point and vec2(1.0,1.0)
     *    will be the bottom right. Note that there is currently a bug in
     *    Cogl where when rendering to an offscreen buffer these
     *    coordinates will be upside-down. The value is undefined when not
     *    rendering points.
     *
     * Here is an example of using a snippet to add a desaturate effect to the
     * generated color on a pipeline.
     *
     * ```c
     *   CoglPipeline *pipeline = cogl_pipeline_new ();
     *
     *   /<!-- -->* Set up the pipeline here, ie by adding a texture or other
     *      layers *<!-- -->/

     *      we will use to add a uniform. The second is the 'post' string which

     *   CoglSnippet *snippet =
     *     cogl_snippet_new (COGL_SNIPPET_HOOK_FRAGMENT,

     *                       "float gray = dot (vec3 (0.299, 0.587, 0.114), "
     *                       "                  cogl_color_out.rgb);"
     *                       "cogl_color_out.rgb = mix (vec3 (gray),"
     *                       "                          cogl_color_out.rgb,"
     *                       "                          factor);");
     *
     *   /<!-- -->* Add it to the pipeline *<!-- -->/
     *   cogl_pipeline_add_snippet (pipeline, snippet);

     * size to the next larger power-of-two size and then seeing how many
     * wasted pixels that would result in. For example if you have a
     * virtual texture that's 259 texels wide, the next pot size = 512 and

     * remain unallocated after that we choose the next power-of-two size.
     * For the example of a 259 texel image that would mean having a 256
     * texel wide texture, leaving 3 texels unallocated so we'd then
     * create a 4 texel wide texture - now there is only one texel of
     * waste. The algorithm continues to slice the right most textures
     * until the amount of waste is less than or equal to a specified
     * max-waste threshold. The same logic for slicing from left to right
     * is also applied from top to bottom.
