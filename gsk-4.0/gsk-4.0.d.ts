     * A fragment shader gets the coordinates being rendered as input and
     * produces the pixel values for that particular pixel. Additionally,
     * the shader can declare a set of other input arguments, called
     * uniforms (as they are uniform over all the calls to your shader in
     * each instance of use). A shader can also receive up to 4
     * textures that it can use as input when producing the pixel data.
     *
     * `GskGLShader` is usually used with gtk_snapshot_push_gl_shader()
     * to produce a [class`Gsk`.GLShaderNode] in the rendering hierarchy,
     * and then its input textures are constructed by rendering the child
     * nodes to textures before rendering the shader node itself. (You can
     * pass texture nodes as children if you want to directly use a texture
     * as input).
     *
     * The actual shader code is GLSL code that gets combined with
     * some other code into the fragment shader. Since the exact
     * capabilities of the GPU driver differs between different OpenGL
     * drivers and hardware, GTK adds some defines that you can use
     * to ensure your GLSL code runs on as many drivers as it can.
     *
     * If the OpenGL driver is GLES, then the shader language version
     * is set to 100, and GSK_GLES will be defined in the shader.
     *
     * Otherwise, if the OpenGL driver does not support the 3.2 core profile,
     * then the shader will run with language version 110 for GL2 and 130 for GL3,
     * and GSK_LEGACY will be defined in the shader.
     *
     * If the OpenGL driver supports the 3.2 code profile, it will be used,
     * the shader language version is set to 150, and GSK_GL3 will be defined
     * in the shader.
     *
     * The main function the shader must implement is:
     *
     * ```glsl
     *  void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
     *                 in vec2 fragCoord,
     *                 in vec2 resolution,
     *                 in vec2 uv)
     * ```
     *
     * Where the input `fragCoord` is the coordinate of the pixel we're
     * currently rendering, relative to the boundary rectangle that was
     * specified in the `GskGLShaderNode`, and `resolution` is the width and
     * height of that rectangle. This is in the typical GTK coordinate
     * system with the origin in the top left. `uv` contains the u and v
     * coordinates that can be used to index a texture at the
     * corresponding point. These coordinates are in the [0..1]x[0..1]
     * region, with 0, 0 being in the lower left corder (which is typical
     * for OpenGL).
     *
     * The output `fragColor` should be a RGBA color (with
     * premultiplied alpha) that will be used as the output for the
     * specified pixel location. Note that this output will be
     * automatically clipped to the clip region of the glshader node.
     *
     * In addition to the function arguments the shader can define
     * up to 4 uniforms for textures which must be called u_textureN
     * (i.e. u_texture1 to u_texture4) as well as any custom uniforms
     * you want of types int, uint, bool, float, vec2, vec3 or vec4.
     *
     * All textures sources contain premultiplied alpha colors, but if some
     * there are outer sources of colors there is a gsk_premultiply() helper
     * to compute premultiplication when needed.
     *
     * Note that GTK parses the uniform declarations, so each uniform has to
     * be on a line by itself with no other code, like so:
     *
     * ```glsl
     * uniform float u_time;
     * uniform vec3 u_color;
     * uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
     * uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
     * ```
     *
     * GTK uses the "gsk" namespace in the symbols it uses in the
     * shader, so your code should not use any symbols with the prefix gsk
     * or GSK. There are some helper functions declared that you can use:
     *
     * ```glsl
     * vec4 GskTexture(sampler2D sampler, vec2 texCoords);
     * ```
     *
     * This samples a texture (e.g. u_texture1) at the specified
     * coordinates, and contains some helper ifdefs to ensure that
     * it works on all OpenGL versions.
     *
     * You can compile the shader yourself using [method`Gsk`.GLShader.compile],
     * otherwise the GSK renderer will do it when it handling the glshader
     * node. If errors occurs, the returned `error` will include the glsl
     * sources, so you can see what GSK was passing to the compiler. You
     * can also set GSK_DEBUG=shaders in the environment to see the sources
     * and other relevant information about all shaders that GSK is handling.
     *
     * # An example shader
     *
     * ```glsl
     * uniform float position;
     * uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
     * uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
     *
     * void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
     *                in vec2 fragCoord,
     *                in vec2 resolution,
     *                in vec2 uv) {
     *   vec4 source1 = GskTexture(u_texture1, uv);
     *   vec4 source2 = GskTexture(u_texture2, uv);
     *
     *   fragColor = position * source1 + (1.0 - position) * source2;
     * }
     * ```
