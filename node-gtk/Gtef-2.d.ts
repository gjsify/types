     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * Obtains the frame clock for a widget. The frame clock is a global
     * “ticker” that can be used to drive animations and repaints.  The
     * most common reason to get the frame clock is to call
     * gdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time(), in order to get a time to use for
     * animating. For example you might record the start of the animation
     * with an initial value from gdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time(), and
     * then update the animation by calling
     * gdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time() again during each repaint.
     * 
     * gdk_frame_clock_request_phase() will result in a new frame on the
     * clock, but won’t necessarily repaint any widgets. To repaint a
     * widget, you have to use gtk_widget_queue_draw() which invalidates
     * the widget (thus scheduling it to receive a draw on the next
     * frame). gtk_widget_queue_draw() will also end up requesting a frame
     * on the appropriate frame clock.
     * 
     * A widget’s frame clock will not change while the widget is
     * mapped. Reparenting a widget (which implies a temporary unmap) can
     * change the widget’s frame clock.
     *

     * when using the drag-motion signal that way.
