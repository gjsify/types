     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     *   The content served is music, for example, music stores such as

     *   tagged as "country:uk". Country codes should be an ISO-639-1 or
     *   ISO-639-2 code.
     * 
     * - "protocol:protocol-name"
     *   The content browsing or searching uses a particular protocol, such
     *   as DLNA/UPnP or DMAP/DAAP. This makes it easier to whitelist or

     *   we're not connected to a network.

     * 
     * The tags are arbitrary, and applications should just pass over the tags
     * it does not understand. Applications would usually use this to either
     * group sources together, or hide certain sources: a radio application
     * would filter for %GRL_MEDIA_TYPE_AUDIO in GrlSource::supported-media as
     * well as "radio" being listed in the tags.
     * 
     * To avoid irrelevant content being listed in applications, sources
     * such as generic video sites should not be tagged as "cinema" or
     * "tv" as they contain a lot of content that's not either of those.
     * 
     * This is a list of commonly used values:
     * 
     * - "cinema", or "tv"
     *   The content served is from cinema or TV sources. For example, a
     *   source for movie trailers would select the former, a source for
     *   streaming live TV would select the latter.
     * 
     * - "radio"
     *   The content served is from streaming radios.
     * 
     * - "music"
     *   The content served is music, for example, music stores such as
     *   Jamendo or Magnatune.
     * 
     * - "country:country-code"
     *   The content is mostly relevant to users from a particular country,
     *   such as a national broadcaster. For example, BBC content would be
     *   tagged as "country:uk". Country codes should be an ISO-639-1 or
     *   ISO-639-2 code.
     * 
     * - "protocol:protocol-name"
     *   The content browsing or searching uses a particular protocol, such
     *   as DLNA/UPnP or DMAP/DAAP. This makes it easier to whitelist or
     *   blacklist sources rather than matching the implementation specific
     *   source ID. Examples are "protocol:dlna" and "protocol:dmap".
     * 
     * - "localhost", or "localuser"
     *   The content is served from the machine the application is running on,
     *   or by an application the user is running. Applications might choose to
     *   avoid showing the user's own data in their interfaces, or integrate it
     *   in the user's local collection.
     * 
     *   "net:local", or "net:internet"
     *   The source requires a connection to the local network, or a connection
     *   to the Internet. Sources with those tags will be automatically hidden
     *   from the application's reach when such networks aren't available, or
     *   we're not connected to a network.
     * 
     *   "net:plaintext"
     *   The source makes requests over plain text, non-encrypted, network channels,
     *   such as using HTTP to do searches or lookups. Applications would usually
     *   disable those by default, so that privacy is respected by default, and no
