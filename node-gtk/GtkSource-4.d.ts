     * 
     * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system
     * currently in use. Some windowing systems, such as Wayland, do not
     * support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the

     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
     * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
     * same top-left corner.
     * 
     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The

     *

     * stored across sessions; use gtk_window_set_default_size() to

     * function in response to a size change notification, for instance
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal, or
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::configure-event signal:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget, GtkAllocation *allocation)
     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }

     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
     * you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to

     * to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     *

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     *

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *
