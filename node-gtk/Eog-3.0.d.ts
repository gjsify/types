     * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted.  At this
     * point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by `arg_data`
     * in the given #GOptionEntrys.
     * 
     * Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a %NULL
     * `arg_data` for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
     * argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
     * passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be
     * inspected and modified.  If %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is
     * set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
     * where g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it.
     * This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
     * booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
     * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
     * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
     * 
     * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
     * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
     * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
     * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
     * possible to either use `arg_data` in the usual way, or to consult (and
     * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
     * 
     * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
     * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
     * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
     * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
     * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
     * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
     * 
     * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
     * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
     * `arg_data` is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
     * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
     * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
     * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
     * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
     * 
     * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
     * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use `i`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use `x`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use `d`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use `^&ay`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY, use `^a&s`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME_ARRAY, use `^a&ay`

     * the process.
     * 
     * What happens next depends on the flags: if
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining

     * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
     * via the #GApplication::open signal.

     * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
     * 
     * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
     * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
     * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,

     * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system

     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
     * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
     * same top-left corner.

     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The
     * appropriate way to implement saving the window position is to

     * call this function.
     * 
     * The dimensions returned by this function are suitable for being
     * stored across sessions; use gtk_window_set_default_size() to
     * restore them when before showing the window.
     *

     * function in response to a size change notification, for instance
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal, or
     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::configure-event signal:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void

     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
     * you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager

     * same top-left corner.

     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The

     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget, GtkAllocation *allocation)
     * {
     *   int new_width, new_height;
     * 
     *   gtk_window_get_size (GTK_WINDOW (widget), &new_width, &new_height);
     * 
     *   ...
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
     * you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to
     * the signal handler, as the allocation may contain client side
     * decorations added by GTK+, depending on the windowing system in
     * use.
     * 
     * If you are getting a window size in order to position the window
     * on the screen, you should, instead, simply set the window’s semantic
     * type with gtk_window_set_type_hint(), which allows the window manager
     * to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of
     * dialogs with gtk_window_set_transient_for() window managers will
     * often center the dialog over its parent window. It's much preferred
     * to let the window manager handle these cases rather than doing it
     * yourself, because all apps will behave consistently and according to
     * user or system preferences, if the window manager handles it. Also,
     * the window manager can take into account the size of the window
     * decorations and border that it may add, and of which GTK+ has no
     * knowledge. Additionally, positioning windows in global screen coordinates

     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
     * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
     * same top-left corner.

     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The
     * appropriate way to implement saving the window position is to

     * because client side decoration may include widgets that depend on
     * the user preferences and that may not be visibile at the time you
     * call this function.
     * 
     * The dimensions returned by this function are suitable for being
     * stored across sessions; use gtk_window_set_default_size() to
     * restore them when before showing the window.
     * 
     * To avoid potential race conditions, you should only call this
     * function in response to a size change notification, for instance

     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
     * 
     * ```c

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *

     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * (#GtkWidget::drag-motion, #GtkWidget::drag-drop, ...). They all exist
     * for convenience. When passing #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_ALL for instance it is
     * sufficient to connect to the widget’s #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
     * signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.
     * 
     * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
     * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
     * behaviors described by `flags` make some assumptions, that can conflict
     * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
     * invokations of gdk_drag_status() in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
     * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
     * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
     * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
     * 
     * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
     * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
     * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void
     * drag_motion (GtkWidget *widget,
     *              GdkDragContext *context,
     *              gint x,
     *              gint y,

     * signal is expected to process the received data and then call
     * gtk_drag_finish(), setting the `success` parameter depending on
     * whether the data was processed successfully.
     * 
     * Applications must create some means to determine why the signal was emitted
     * and therefore whether to call gdk_drag_status() or gtk_drag_finish().

     * The handler may inspect the selected action with
     * gdk_drag_context_get_selected_action() before calling

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the

     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * 
     * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system
     * currently in use. Some windowing systems, such as Wayland, do not
     * support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the

     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
     * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
     * same top-left corner.
     * 
     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The
     * appropriate way to implement saving the window position is to

     *

     *

     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }

     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
