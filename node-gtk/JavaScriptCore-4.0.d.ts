     * 
     * ```c
     * void

     *                          const gchar *new_string)
     * {
     *   // the quark, naming the object data
     *   GQuark quark_string_list = g_quark_from_static_string ("my-string-list");
     *   // retrieve the old string list
     *   GList *list = g_object_steal_qdata (object, quark_string_list);
     * 
     *   // prepend new string
     *   list = g_list_prepend (list, g_strdup (new_string));
     *   // this changed 'list', so we need to set it again
     *   g_object_set_qdata_full (object, quark_string_list, list, free_string_list);
     * }
     * static void
     * free_string_list (gpointer data)

     *     g_free (node->data);
     *   g_list_free (list);
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * Using g_object_get_qdata() in the above example, instead of
     * g_object_steal_qdata() would have left the destroy function set,

     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
