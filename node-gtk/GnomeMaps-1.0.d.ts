     * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
     * instance.
     * 
     * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.

     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
     * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.
