     * The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user
     * moves the cursor over the widget during a drag. The signal handler
     * must determine whether the cursor position is in a drop zone or not.
     * If it is not in a drop zone, it returns %FALSE and no further processing
     * is necessary. Otherwise, the handler returns %TRUE. In this case, the
     * handler is responsible for providing the necessary information for
     * displaying feedback to the user, by calling gdk_drag_status().
     * 
     * If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected can't be
     * made based solely on the cursor position and the type of the data, the
     * handler may inspect the dragged data by calling gtk_drag_get_data() and
     * defer the gdk_drag_status() call to the #GtkWidget::drag-data-received
     * handler. Note that you must pass #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP,

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

     * dragged data has been received. If the data was received in order to
     * determine whether the drop will be accepted, the handler is expected
     * to call gdk_drag_status() and not finish the drag.
     * If the data was received in response to a #GtkWidget::drag-drop signal
     * (and this is the last target to be received), the handler for this
     * signal is expected to process the received data and then call
     * gtk_drag_finish(), setting the `success` parameter depending on
     * whether the data was processed successfully.
     * 
     * Applications must create some means to determine why the signal was emitted
     * and therefore whether to call gdk_drag_status() or gtk_drag_finish().
     * 
     * The handler may inspect the selected action with
     * gdk_drag_context_get_selected_action() before calling
     * gtk_drag_finish(), e.g. to implement %GDK_ACTION_ASK as
     * shown in the following example:
     * 
     * ```c
     * void

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *

     * ```
     *

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     *

     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The ::drag-motion signal is emitted on the drop site when the user
     * moves the cursor over the widget during a drag. The signal handler
     * must determine whether the cursor position is in a drop zone or not.
     * If it is not in a drop zone, it returns %FALSE and no further processing
     * is necessary. Otherwise, the handler returns %TRUE. In this case, the
     * handler is responsible for providing the necessary information for
     * displaying feedback to the user, by calling gdk_drag_status().
     * 
     * If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected can't be
     * made based solely on the cursor position and the type of the data, the
     * handler may inspect the dragged data by calling gtk_drag_get_data() and
     * defer the gdk_drag_status() call to the #GtkWidget::drag-data-received

     * 
     * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system
     * currently in use. Some windowing systems, such as Wayland, do not
     * support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the
     * window will always be (0, 0). Others, like X11, do not have a reliable
     * way to obtain the geometry of the decorations of a window if they are
     * provided by the window manager. Additionally, on X11, window manager
     * have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
     * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
     * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
     * same top-left corner.
     * 
     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
     * 
     * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
     * window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
     * system supports global coordinates.
     * 
     * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
     * applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
     * system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The
     * appropriate way to implement saving the window position is to

     *

     * inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::configure-event signal:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * static void

     * {

     * 
     *   ...
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,

     * gtk_window_parse_geometry() does work on all GTK+ ports
     * including Win32 but is primarily intended for an X environment.
     * 
     * If either a size or a position can be extracted from the
     * geometry string, gtk_window_parse_geometry() returns %TRUE
     * and calls gtk_window_set_default_size() and/or gtk_window_move()
     * to resize/move the window.
     * 
     * If gtk_window_parse_geometry() returns %TRUE, it will also
     * set the #GDK_HINT_USER_POS and/or #GDK_HINT_USER_SIZE hints
     * indicating to the window manager that the size/position of
     * the window was user-specified. This causes most window
     * managers to honor the geometry.
     * 
     * Note that for gtk_window_parse_geometry() to work as expected, it has
     * to be called when the window has its “final” size, i.e. after calling
     * gtk_widget_show_all() on the contents and gtk_window_set_geometry_hints()

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
