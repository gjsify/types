     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of

     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * When the initialization is finished, `callback` will be called. You can
     * then call g_async_initable_init_finish() to get the result of the
     * initialization.
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
     * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
     * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL, and
     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
     * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
     * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
     * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
     * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
     * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times,
     * implementation requires yielding all subsequent calls to init_async() on the
     * results of the first call.
     * 
     * For classes that also support the #GInitable interface, the default
     * implementation of this method will run the g_initable_init() function
     * in a thread, so if you want to support asynchronous initialization via
     * threads, just implement the #GAsyncInitable interface without overriding
     * any interface methods.

     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * ```
     *

     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new

     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.

     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization

     * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
     * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
     * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
     * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times,
     * implementation requires yielding all subsequent calls to init_async() on the
     * results of the first call.
     * 
     * For classes that also support the #GInitable interface, the default
     * implementation of this method will run the g_initable_init() function
     * in a thread, so if you want to support asynchronous initialization via

     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,

     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.
