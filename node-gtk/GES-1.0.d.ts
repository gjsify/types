/**
 * When a single timeline element is edited within its timeline at some
 * position, using ges_timeline_element_edit(), depending on the edit
 * mode, its #GESTimelineElement:start, #GESTimelineElement:duration or
 * #GESTimelineElement:in-point will be adjusted accordingly. In addition,
 * any clips may change #GESClip:layer.
 * 
 * Each edit can be broken down into a combination of three basic edits:
 * 
 * + MOVE: This moves the start of the element to the edit position.
 * + START-TRIM: This cuts or grows the start of the element, whilst
 *   maintaining the time at which its internal content appears in the
 *   timeline data output. If the element is made shorter, the data that
 *   appeared at the edit position will still appear in the timeline at
 *   the same time. If the element is made longer, the data that appeared
 *   at the previous start of the element will still appear in the
 *   timeline at the same time.
 * + END-TRIM: Similar to START-TRIM, but the end of the element is cut or
 *   grown.
 * 
 * In particular, when editing a #GESClip:
 * 
 * + MOVE: This will set the #GESTimelineElement:start of the clip to the
 *   edit position.
 * + START-TRIM: This will set the #GESTimelineElement:start of the clip
 *   to the edit position. To keep the end time the same, the
 *   #GESTimelineElement:duration of the clip will be adjusted in the
 *   opposite direction. In addition, the #GESTimelineElement:in-point of
 *   the clip will be shifted such that the content that appeared at the
 *   new or previous start time, whichever is latest, still appears at the
 *   same timeline time. For example, if a frame appeared at the start of
 *   the clip, and the start of the clip is reduced, the in-point of the
 *   clip will also reduce such that the frame will appear later within
 *   the clip, but at the same timeline position.
 * + END-TRIM: This will set the #GESTimelineElement:duration of the clip
 *   such that its end time will match the edit position.
 * 
 * When editing a #GESGroup:
 * 
 * + MOVE: This will set the #GESGroup:start of the clip to the edit
 *   position by shifting all of its children by the same amount. So each
 *   child will maintain their relative positions.
 * + START-TRIM: If the group is made shorter, this will START-TRIM any
 *   clips under the group that start after the edit position to the same
 *   edit position. If the group is made longer, this will START-TRIM any
 *   clip under the group whose start matches the start of the group to
 *   the same edit position.
 * + END-TRIM: If the group is made shorter, this will END-TRIM any clips
 *   under the group that end after the edit position to the same edit
 *   position. If the group is made longer, this will END-TRIM any clip
 *   under the group whose end matches the end of the group to the same
 *   edit position.
 * 
 * When editing a #GESTrackElement, if it has a #GESClip parent, this
 * will be edited instead. Otherwise it is edited in the same way as a
 * #GESClip.
 * 
 * The layer priority of a #GESGroup is the lowest layer priority of any
 * #GESClip underneath it. When a group is edited to a new layer
 * priority, it will shift all clips underneath it by the same amount,
 * such that their relative layers stay the same.
 * 
 * If the #GESTimeline has a #GESTimeline:snapping-distance, then snapping
 * may occur for some of the edges of the **main** edited element:
 * 
 * + MOVE: The start or end edge of *any* #GESSource under the element may
 *   be snapped.
 * + START-TRIM: The start edge of a #GESSource whose start edge touches
 *   the start edge of the element may snap.
 * + END-TRIM: The end edge of a #GESSource whose end edge touches the end
 *   edge of the element may snap.
 * 
 * These edges may snap with either the start or end edge of *any* other
 * #GESSource in the timeline that is not also being moved by the element,
 * including those in different layers, if they are within the
 * #GESTimeline:snapping-distance. During an edit, only up to one snap can
 * occur. This will shift the edit position such that the snapped edges
 * will touch once the edit has completed.
 * 
 * Note that snapping can cause an edit to fail where it would have
 * otherwise succeeded because it may push the edit position such that the
 * edit would result in an unsupported timeline configuration. Similarly,
 * snapping can cause an edit to succeed where it would have otherwise
 * failed.
 * 
 * For example, in #GES_EDIT_MODE_RIPPLE acting on #GES_EDGE_NONE, the
 * main element is the MOVED toplevel of the edited element. Any source
 * under the main MOVED toplevel may have its start or end edge snapped.
 * Note, these sources cannot snap with each other. The edit may also
 * push other elements, but any sources under these elements cannot snap,
 * nor can they be snapped with. If a snap does occur, the MOVE of the
 * toplevel *and* all other elements pushed by the ripple will be shifted
 * by the same amount such that the snapped edges will touch.
 * 
 * You can also find more explanation about the behaviour of those modes at:
 * [trim, ripple and roll](http://pitivi.org/manual/trimming.html)
 * and [clip management](http://pitivi.org/manual/usingclips.html).

     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.

     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()

     * to select which tracks the element should be added to.
     * 
     * Finally, as a special case, if a track is added to the timeline
     * *after* it already contains clips, then it will request the creation
     * of the clips' core elements of the corresponding type, if they have
     * not already been created, and this signal will be emitted for each of
     * these newly created elements. In addition, this will also be released

     * will only check whether the newly added track appears in the track
     * list. If it does appear, the track element will be added to the newly
     * added track. All other tracks in the returned track list are ignored.
     * 
     * In this latter case, track elements that are already part of a track

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *

     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,

     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not

     * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error

     * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
     * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
     * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
     * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or

     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
     * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().

     * Initializes the object implementing the interface.
     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
     * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
     * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
     * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
     * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
     * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
     * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.
     * @param cancellable optional #GCancellable object, %NULL to ignore.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a

     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.

     * rate, i.e. a value of 2.0 must mean that the media plays twice as fast.
     * Several properties may be registered for a single element type,
     * provided they all contribute to the rate as independent factors. For
     * example, this is true for the "GstPitch::rate" and "GstPitch::tempo"
     * properties. These are already registered by default in GES, along with
     * #videorate:rate for #videorate and #scaletempo:rate for #scaletempo.
     * 
     * If such a rate property becomes a child property of a #GESEffect upon
     * its creation (the element is part of its #GESEffect:bin-description),
     * it will be automatically registered as a time property (see

     * translation functions set (see
     * ges_base_effect_set_time_translation_funcs()) to use the overall rate
     * of the rate properties. Note that if an effect contains a rate
     * property as well as a non-rate time property, you should ensure to set
     * the time translation functions to some other methods using
     * ges_base_effect_set_time_translation_funcs().
