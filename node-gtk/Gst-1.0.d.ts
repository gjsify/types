 * Flags to be used with gst_element_seek() or gst_event_new_seek(). All flags

 * A non flushing seek might take some time to perform as the currently
 * playing data in the pipeline will not be cleared.
 * 
 * An accurate seek might be slower for formats that don't have any indexes
 * or timestamp markers in the stream. Specifying this flag might require a
 * complete scan of the file in those cases.
 * 
 * When performing a segment seek: after the playback of the segment completes,
 * no EOS will be emitted by the element that performed the seek, but a
 * %GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE message will be posted on the bus by the element.
 * When this message is posted, it is possible to send a new seek event to
 * continue playback. With this seek method it is possible to perform seamless
 * looping or simple linear editing.
 * 
 * When only changing the playback rate and not the direction, the
 * %GST_SEEK_FLAG_INSTANT_RATE_CHANGE flag can be used for a non-flushing seek
 * to signal that the rate change should be applied immediately. This requires
 * special support in the seek handlers (e.g. demuxers) and any elements
 * synchronizing to the clock, and in general can't work in all cases (for example
 * UDP streaming where the delivery rate is controlled by a remote server). The
 * instant-rate-change mode supports changing the trickmode-related GST_SEEK_ flags,
 * but can't be used in conjunction with other seek flags that affect the new
 * playback position - as the playback position will not be changing.
 * 
 * When doing fast forward (rate > 1.0) or fast reverse (rate < -1.0) trickmode
 * playback, the %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE flag can be used to instruct decoders
 * and demuxers to adjust the playback rate by skipping frames. This can improve
 * performance and decrease CPU usage because not all frames need to be decoded.
 * 
 * Beyond that, the %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_KEY_UNITS flag can be used to
 * request that decoders skip all frames except key units, and
 * %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_NO_AUDIO flags can be used to request that audio
 * decoders do no decoding at all, and simple output silence.
 * 
 * The %GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_BEFORE flag can be used to snap to the previous
 * relevant location, and the %GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_AFTER flag can be used to
 * select the next relevant location. If %GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT is specified,
 * the relevant location is a keyframe. If both flags are specified, the nearest
 * of these locations will be selected. If none are specified, the implementation is
 * free to select whichever it wants.
 * 
 * The before and after here are in running time, so when playing backwards,
 * the next location refers to the one that will played in next, and not the
 * one that is located after in the actual source stream.
 * 
 * Also see part-seeking.txt in the GStreamer design documentation for more
 * details on the meaning of these flags and the behaviour expected of
 * elements that handle them.

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
