 * 
 * A predefined schema that is compatible with items stored via the

 * applications migrating from libgnome-keyring which stored their secrets as
 * 'network passwords'. It is not recommended that new code use this schema.

     * Starts asynchronous initialization of the object implementing the
     * interface. This must be done before any real use of the object after
     * initial construction. If the object also implements #GInitable you can
     * optionally call g_initable_init() instead.
     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * When the initialization is finished, `callback` will be called. You can
     * then call g_async_initable_init_finish() to get the result of the
     * initialization.
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
     * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
     * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL, and
     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
     * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
     * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
     * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
     * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
     * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times,
     * implementation requires yielding all subsequent calls to init_async() on the
     * results of the first call.
     * 
     * For classes that also support the #GInitable interface, the default
     * implementation of this method will run the g_initable_init() function
     * in a thread, so if you want to support asynchronous initialization via
     * threads, just implement the #GAsyncInitable interface without overriding

     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
