     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()

     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,

     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
     * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
     * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL, and
