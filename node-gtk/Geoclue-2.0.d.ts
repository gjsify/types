     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * When the initialization is finished, `callback` will be called. You can
     * then call g_async_initable_init_finish() to get the result of the
     * initialization.
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not

     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
     * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
     * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and

     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.

     * Initializes the object implementing the interface.
     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
     * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
     * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
     * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
     * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
     * 
     * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
     * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
     * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
     * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
     * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
     * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.
     * @param cancellable optional #GCancellable object, %NULL to ignore.

     * 
     * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
     * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
     * 
     * When the initialization is finished, `callback` will be called. You can

     * initialization.
     * 
     * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
     * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
     * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
     * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL, and

     * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
     * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
     * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
