     * instance.
     *

     * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
     * will be updated as well.
     * 
     * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
     * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
     * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
     * #GBinding instance.
