     * After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
     * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted.  At this
     * point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by `arg_data`
     * in the given #GOptionEntrys.
     * 
     * Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a %NULL
     * `arg_data` for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
     * argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
     * passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be

     * set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
     * where g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it.
     * This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
     * booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
     * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
     * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
     * 
     * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
     * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
     * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
     * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
     * possible to either use `arg_data` in the usual way, or to consult (and
     * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
     * 
     * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
     * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
     * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
     * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
     * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
     * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
     * 
     * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
     * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
     * `arg_data` is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
     * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
     * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
     * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
     * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
     * 
     * The dict includes options that have been explicitly specified on the parsed
     * commandline, as well as zero values for numeric options that were not
     * necessarily specified.
     * 
     * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
     * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use `i`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use `x`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use `d`
     * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use `^&ay`

     * application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
     * 
     * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options

     * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
     * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
     * the process.
     * 
     * What happens next depends on the flags: if
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
     * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
     * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
     * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
     * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
     * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
     * via the #GApplication::open signal.
     * 
     * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the

     * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want

     * suppress the default handling. See
     * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c]

     * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is

     * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
     * 
     * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
     * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
     * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
     * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
     * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
     * use.
     * 
     * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,

     * 
     * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
     * for the duration that the application is running.

     * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
     * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
