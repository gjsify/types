     * 
     * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
     * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
     * supporting this. Generally, a classâ€™ implementation of init() can assume

     * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
     * 
     * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
     * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
     * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
