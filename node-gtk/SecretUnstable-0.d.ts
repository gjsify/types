     * it, then `value` is checked against the type of the property.
     * 
     * If the `value` #GVariant is floating, it is consumed. This allows
     * convenient 'inline' use of g_variant_new(), e.g.
     * 
     * ```c
     *  g_dbus_proxy_set_cached_property (proxy,
     *                                    "SomeProperty",

     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Normally you will not need to use this method since `proxy`
     * is tracking changes using the
     * `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged`
     * D-Bus signal. However, for performance reasons an object may
     * decide to not use this signal for some properties and instead
     * use a proprietary out-of-band mechanism to transmit changes.
     * 
     * As a concrete example, consider an object with a property
     * `ChatroomParticipants` which is an array of strings. Instead of
     * transmitting the same (long) array every time the property changes,
     * it is more efficient to only transmit the delta using e.g. signals
     * `ChatroomParticipantJoined(String name)` and

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
     * 
     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()

     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
