     * A convenience function that attempts to connect all possible
     * #GUPnPService::action-invoked and #GUPnPService::query-variable signals to
     * appropriate callbacks for the service `service`. It uses service introspection
     * and #GModule<!-- -->'s introspective features. It is very simillar to
     * gtk_builder_connect_signals() except that it attempts to guess the names of
     * the signal handlers on its own.
     * 
     * For this function to do its magic, the application must name the callback
     * functions for #GUPnPService::action-invoked signals by striping the CamelCase
     * off the action names and either prepend "on_" or append "_cb" to them. Same
     * goes for #GUPnPService::query-variable signals, except that "query_" should
     * be prepended to the variable name. For example, callback function for
     * <varname>GetSystemUpdateID</varname> action should be either named as
     * "get_system_update_id_cb" or "on_get_system_update_id" and callback function
     * for the query of "SystemUpdateID" state variable should be named
     * <function>query_system_update_id_cb</function> or
     * <function>on_query_system_update_id</function>.
     * 
     * <note>This function will not work correctly if #GModule is not supported
     * on the platform or introspection is not available for `service`.</note>
     * 
     * <warning>This function can not and therefore does not guarantee that the
     * resulting signal connections will be correct as it depends heavily on a
     * particular naming schemes described above.</warning>

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     *

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
