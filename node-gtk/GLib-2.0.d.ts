 * will still be locked in the child process, and they will never be

 * POSIX allows only async-signal-safe functions (see signal(7)) to be
 * called in the child between fork() and exec(), which drastically limits
 * the usefulness of child setup functions.

 * call malloc(), which includes POSIX functions such as setenv().

     * Waits until either `cond` is signalled or `end_time` has passed.
     * 
     * As with g_cond_wait() it is possible that a spurious or stolen wakeup
     * could occur.  For that reason, waiting on a condition variable should
     * always be in a loop, based on an explicitly-checked predicate.
     * 
     * %TRUE is returned if the condition variable was signalled (or in the
     * case of a spurious wakeup).  %FALSE is returned if `end_time` has
     * passed.
     * 
     * The following code shows how to correctly perform a timed wait on a
     * condition variable (extending the example presented in the
     * documentation for #GCond):
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * gpointer
     * pop_data_timed (void)
     * {
     *   gint64 end_time;
     *   gpointer data;
     * 
     *   g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
     * 
     *   end_time = g_get_monotonic_time () + 5 * G_TIME_SPAN_SECOND;
     *   while (!current_data)
     *     if (!g_cond_wait_until (&data_cond, &data_mutex, end_time))
     *       {
     *         // timeout has passed.
     *         g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
     *         return NULL;
     *       }
     * 
     *   // there is data for us
     *   data = current_data;
     *   current_data = NULL;
     * 
     *   g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
     * 
     *   return data;
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * Notice that the end time is calculated once, before entering the
     * loop and reused.  This is the motivation behind the use of absolute
     * time on this API -- if a relative time of 5 seconds were passed
     * directly to the call and a spurious wakeup occurred, the program would
     * have to start over waiting again (which would lead to a total wait
     * time of more than 5 seconds).
