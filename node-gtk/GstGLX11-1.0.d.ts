     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
