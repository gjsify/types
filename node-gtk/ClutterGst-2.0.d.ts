    /**
     * Defines the circumstances where the actor should be redirected into
     * an offscreen image. The offscreen image is used to flatten the
     * actor into a single image while painting for two main reasons.
     * Firstly, when the actor is painted a second time without any of its
     * contents changing it can simply repaint the cached image without
     * descending further down the actor hierarchy. Secondly, it will make
     * the opacity look correct even if there are overlapping primitives
     * in the actor.
     * 
     * Caching the actor could in some cases be a performance win and in
     * some cases be a performance lose so it is important to determine
     * which value is right for an actor before modifying this value. For
     * example, there is never any reason to flatten an actor that is just
     * a single texture (such as a #ClutterTexture) because it is
     * effectively already cached in an image so the offscreen would be
     * redundant. Also if the actor contains primitives that are far apart
     * with a large transparent area in the middle (such as a large
     * CluterGroup with a small actor in the top left and a small actor in
     * the bottom right) then the cached image will contain the entire
     * image of the large area and the paint will waste time blending all
     * of the transparent pixels in the middle.
     * 
     * The default method of implementing opacity on a container simply
     * forwards on the opacity to all of the children. If the children are
     * overlapping then it will appear as if they are two separate glassy
     * objects and there will be a break in the color where they
     * overlap. By redirecting to an offscreen buffer it will be as if the
     * two opaque objects are combined into one and then made transparent
     * which is usually what is expected.
     * 
     * The image below demonstrates the difference between redirecting and
     * not. The image shows two Clutter groups, each containing a red and
     * a green rectangle which overlap. The opacity on the group is set to
     * 128 (which is 50%). When the offscreen redirect is not used, the
     * red rectangle can be seen through the blue rectangle as if the two
     * rectangles were separately transparent. When the redirect is used
     * the group as a whole is transparent instead so the red rectangle is
     * not visible where they overlap.
     * 
     * <figure id="offscreen-redirect">
     *   <title>Sample of using an offscreen redirect for transparency</title>
     *   <graphic fileref="offscreen-redirect.png" format="PNG"/>
     * </figure>
     * 
     * The default value for this property is 0, so we effectively will
     * never redirect an actor offscreen by default. This means that there
     * are times that transparent actors may look glassy as described
     * above. The reason this is the default is because there is a
     * performance trade off between quality and performance here. In many
     * cases the default form of glassy opacity looks good enough, but if
     * it's not you will need to set the
     * %CLUTTER_OFFSCREEN_REDIRECT_AUTOMATIC_FOR_OPACITY flag to enable
     * redirection for opacity.
     * 
     * Custom actors that don't contain any overlapping primitives are
     * recommended to override the has_overlaps() virtual to return %FALSE
     * for maximum efficiency.
