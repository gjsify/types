     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use

     * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.

     * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
     * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
     * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
     * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
     * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
     * instance.
