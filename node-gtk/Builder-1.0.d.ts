     * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
     * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
     * 
     * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
     * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
     * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
     * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
     * possible to either use `arg_data` in the usual way, or to consult (and
     * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
     * 
     * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
     * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
     * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
     * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
     * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
     * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
     * 
     * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
     * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
     * `arg_data` is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
     * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
     * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
     * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
     * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).

     * The dict includes options that have been explicitly specified on the parsed
     * commandline, as well as zero values for numeric options that were not
     * necessarily specified.

     * required.  Note that on Windows, `argc` and `argv` are ignored, and

     * of Unicode commandline arguments).
     * 
     * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You

     * application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
     * 
     * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
     * such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
     * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
     * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
     * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
     * the process.
     * 
     * What happens next depends on the flags: if
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
     * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
     * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
     * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
     * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
     * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
     * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
     * via the #GApplication::open signal.
     * 
     * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
     * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
     * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
     * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
     * suppress the default handling. See
     * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c]
     * for an example.
     * 
     * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
     * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
     * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
     * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
     * 
     * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
     * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
     * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
     * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
     * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
     * use.
     * 
     * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
     * to the basename of argv[0].
     * 
     * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
     * for the duration that the application is running.
     * 
     * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
     * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER are given as flags) will check (from the
     * default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
     * was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
     * commandline processing is interrupted and the
     * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
     * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
     * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
     * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
     * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
     * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
     * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
     * should not be used from applications like editors that need precise

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     *

     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as

     * (#GtkWidget::drag-motion, #GtkWidget::drag-drop, ...). They all exist

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.

     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has

     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the

     * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
     * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
     * 
     * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
     * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.

     * returned by this function.
     * 
     * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
     * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()
     * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
     * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
     * same top-left corner.
     * 
     * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
     * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
     * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
     * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
     * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
