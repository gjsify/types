 * The external clock is the sink's element clock, the internal one is the

 * valid timestamps, except for when a discontinuity happens.
 * 
 * requested_skew is an output value the callback can write to. It informs the

     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:

     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
