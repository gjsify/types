     * It extends the [class`Gtk`.TextBuffer] class by adding features useful to display
     * and edit source code such as syntax highlighting and bracket matching.
     *
     * To create a `GtkSourceBuffer` use [ctor`GtkSource`.Buffer.new] or
     * [ctor`GtkSource`.Buffer.new_with_language]. The second form is just a convenience
     * function which allows you to initially set a [class`Language]`. You can also
     * directly create a [class`View]` and get its [class`Buffer]` with
     * [method`Gtk`.TextView.get_buffer].
     *
     * The highlighting is enabled by default, but you can disable it with
     * [method`Buffer`.set_highlight_syntax].
     *
     * # Context Classes:
     *
     * It is possible to retrieve some information from the syntax highlighting
     * engine. The default context classes that are applied to regions of a
     * `GtkSourceBuffer`:
     *
     *  - **comment**: the region delimits a comment;
     *  - **no-spell-check**: the region should not be spell checked;
     *  - **path**: the region delimits a path to a file;
     *  - **string**: the region delimits a string.
     *
     * Custom language definition files can create their own context classes,
     * since the functions like [method`Buffer`.iter_has_context_class] take
     * a string parameter as the context class.
     *
     * `GtkSourceBuffer` provides an API to access the context classes:
     * [method`Buffer`.iter_has_context_class],
     * [method`Buffer`.get_context_classes_at_iter],
     * [method`Buffer`.iter_forward_to_context_class_toggle] and
     * [method`Buffer`.iter_backward_to_context_class_toggle].
     *
     * And the [signal`GtkSource`.Buffer::highlight-updated] signal permits to be notified
     * when a context class region changes.
     *
     * Each context class has also an associated [class`Gtk`.TextTag] with the name
     * `gtksourceview:context-classes:<name>`. For example to
     * retrieve the [class`Gtk`.TextTag] for the string context class, one can write:
     * ```c
     * GtkTextTagTable *tag_table;
     * GtkTextTag *tag;
     *
     * tag_table = gtk_text_buffer_get_tag_table (buffer);
     * tag = gtk_text_tag_table_lookup (tag_table, "gtksourceview:context-classes:string");
     * ```
     * ```python
     * buffer = GtkSource.Buffer()
     *
     * tag_table = buffer.get_tag_table()
     * tag = tag_table.lookup(name="gtksourceview:context-classes:string")
     * ```
     *
     * The tag must be used for read-only purposes.
     *
     * Accessing a context class via the associated [class`Gtk`.TextTag] is less
     * convenient than the `GtkSourceBuffer` API, because:
     *
     *  - The tag doesn't always exist, you need to listen to the
     *    [signal`Gtk`.TextTagTable::tag-added] and [signal`Gtk`.TextTagTable::tag-removed] signals.
     *  - Instead of the [signal`GtkSource`.Buffer::highlight-updated] signal, you can listen
     *    to the [signal`Gtk`.TextBuffer::apply-tag] and [signal`Gtk`.TextBuffer::remove-tag] signals.
     *
     * A possible use-case for accessing a context class via the associated
     * [class`Gtk`.TextTag] is to read the region but without adding a hard dependency on the
     * GtkSourceView library (for example for a spell-checking library that wants to
     * read the no-spell-check region).

     * Gutter cell renderer.
     *
     * A `GtkSourceGutterRenderer` represents a column in a [class`Gutter]`. The
     * column contains one cell for each visible line of the [class`Gtk`.TextBuffer]. Due to
     * text wrapping, a cell can thus span multiple lines of the [class`Gtk`.TextView]. In
     * this case, [enum`GutterRendererAlignmentMode]` controls the alignment of
     * the cell.
     *
     * The gutter renderer is a [class`Gtk`.Widget] and is measured using the normal widget
     * measurement facilities. The width of the gutter will be determined by the
     * measurements of the gutter renderers.
     *
     * The width of a gutter renderer generally takes into account the entire text
     * buffer. For instance, to display the line numbers, if the buffer contains 100
     * lines, the gutter renderer will always set its width such as three digits can
     * be printed, even if only the first 20 lines are shown. Another strategy is to
     * take into account only the visible lines.  In this case, only two digits are
     * necessary to display the line numbers of the first 20 lines. To take another
     * example, the gutter renderer for [class`Mark]`s doesn't need to take
     * into account the text buffer to announce its width. It only depends on the
     * icons size displayed in the gutter column.
     *
     * When the available size to render a cell is greater than the required size to
     * render the cell contents, the cell contents can be aligned horizontally and
     * vertically with [method`GutterRenderer`.set_alignment_mode].
     *
     * The cells rendering occurs using [vfunc`Gtk`.Widget.snapshot]. Implementations
     * should use `gtk_source_gutter_renderer_get_lines()` to retrieve information
     * about the lines to be rendered. To help with aligning content which takes
     * into account the padding and alignment of a cell, implementations may call
     * [method`GutterRenderer`.align_cell] for a given line number with the
     * width and height measurement of the content they width to render.

     * The background color is used as a background of a line where a mark is placed
     * and it can be set with [method`MarkAttributes`.set_background]. To check

     * example use is showing a red filled circle in a debugger to show that a

     * a gutter, first a base for it must be specified and then
     * [method`MarkAttributes`.render_icon] must be called.

     * Region utility.
     *
     * A `GtkSourceRegion` permits to store a group of subregions of a
     * [class`Gtk`.TextBuffer]. `GtkSourceRegion` stores the subregions with pairs of
     * [class`Gtk`.TextMark]'s, so the region is still valid after insertions and deletions
     * in the [class`Gtk`.TextBuffer].
     *
     * The [class`Gtk`.TextMark] for the start of a subregion has a left gravity, while the
     * [class`Gtk`.TextMark] for the end of a subregion has a right gravity.
     *
     * The typical use-case of `GtkSourceRegion` is to scan a [class`Gtk`.TextBuffer] chunk by
     * chunk, not the whole buffer at once to not block the user interface. The
     * `GtkSourceRegion` represents in that case the remaining region to scan. You
     * can listen to the [signal`Gtk`.TextBuffer::insert-text] and
     * [signal`Gtk`.TextBuffer::delete-range] signals to update the `GtkSourceRegion`
     * accordingly.
     *
     * To iterate through the subregions, you need to use a [struct`RegionIter]`,
     * for example:
     * ```c
     * GtkSourceRegion *region;
     * GtkSourceRegionIter region_iter;
     *
     * gtk_source_region_get_start_region_iter (region, &region_iter);
     *
     * while (!gtk_source_region_iter_is_end (&region_iter))

     *         GtkTextIter subregion_start;
     *         GtkTextIter subregion_end;
     *
     *         if (!gtk_source_region_iter_get_subregion (&region_iter,
     *                                                    &subregion_start,
     *                                                    &subregion_end))
     *         {

     *         }
     *
     *         // Do something useful with the subregion.
     *
     *         gtk_source_region_iter_next (&region_iter);
     * }
     * ```
     * ```python
     * buffer: GtkSource.Buffer = GtkSource.Buffer()
     * region: GtkSource.Region = GtkSource.Region(buffer=buffer)
     * region_iter = region.get_start_region_iter()

     * Search context.
     *
     * A `GtkSourceSearchContext` is used for the search and replace in a
     * [class`Buffer]`. The search settings are represented by a
     * [class`SearchSettings]` object. There can be a many-to-many relationship
     * between buffers and search settings, with the search contexts in-between: a
     * search settings object can be shared between several search contexts; and a
     * buffer can contain several search contexts at the same time.
     *
     * The total number of search occurrences can be retrieved with
     * [method`SearchContext`.get_occurrences_count]. To know the position of a
     * certain match, use [method`SearchContext`.get_occurrence_position].
     *
     * The buffer is scanned asynchronously, so it doesn't block the user interface.
     * For each search, the buffer is scanned at most once. After that, navigating
     * through the occurrences doesn't require to re-scan the buffer entirely.
     *
     * To search forward, use [method`SearchContext`.forward] or
     * [method`SearchContext`.forward_async] for the asynchronous version.
     * The backward search is done similarly. To replace a search match, or all
     * matches, use [method`SearchContext`.replace] and
     * [method`SearchContext`.replace_all].
     *
     * The search occurrences are highlighted by default. To disable it, use
     * [method`SearchContext`.set_highlight]. You can enable the search
     * highlighting for several `GtkSourceSearchContext`s attached to the
     * same buffer. Moreover, each of those `GtkSourceSearchContext`s can
     * have a different text style associated. Use
     * [method`SearchContext`.set_match_style] to specify the [class`Style]`
     * to apply on search matches.
     *
     * Note that the [property`SearchContext:`highlight] and
     * [property`SearchContext:`match-style] properties are in the
     * `GtkSourceSearchContext` class, not [class`SearchSettings]`. Appearance
     * settings should be tied to one, and only one buffer, as different buffers can
     * have different style scheme associated (a [class`SearchSettings]` object
     * can be bound indirectly to several buffers).
     *
     * The concept of "current match" doesn't exist yet. A way to highlight
     * differently the current match is to select it.
     *
     * A search occurrence's position doesn't depend on the cursor position or other
     * parameters. Take for instance the buffer "aaaa" with the search text "aa".
     * The two occurrences are at positions [0:2] and [2:4]. If you begin to search
     * at position 1, you will get the occurrence [2:4], not [1:3]. This is a
     * prerequisite for regular expression searches. The pattern ".*" matches the
     * entire line. If the cursor is at the middle of the line, you don't want the
     * rest of the line as the occurrence, you want an entire line. (As a side note,
     * regular expression searches can also match multiple lines.)
     *
     * In the GtkSourceView source code, there is an example of how to use the
     * search and replace API: see the tests/test-search.c file. It is a mini
     * application for the search and replace, with a basic user interface.

     * #GtkSourceSpaceDrawer provides a way to visualize white spaces, by drawing
     * symbols.
     *
     * Call [method`View`.get_space_drawer] to get the `GtkSourceSpaceDrawer`
     * instance of a certain [class`View]`.
     *
     * By default, no white spaces are drawn because the
     * [property`SpaceDrawer:`enable-matrix] is %FALSE.
     *
     * To draw white spaces, [method`SpaceDrawer`.set_types_for_locations] can
     * be called to set the [property`SpaceDrawer:`matrix] property (by default all
     * space types are enabled at all locations). Then call
     * [method`SpaceDrawer`.set_enable_matrix].
     *
     * For a finer-grained method, there is also the [class`Tag]`'s
     * [property`Tag:`draw-spaces] property.
     *
     * # Example
     *
     * To draw non-breaking spaces everywhere and draw all types of trailing spaces
     * except newlines:
     * ```c
     * gtk_source_space_drawer_set_types_for_locations (space_drawer,
     *                                                  GTK_SOURCE_SPACE_LOCATION_ALL,

     *                                                  GTK_SOURCE_SPACE_LOCATION_TRAILING,
     *                                                  GTK_SOURCE_SPACE_TYPE_ALL &
     *                                                  ~GTK_SOURCE_SPACE_TYPE_NEWLINE);
     *
     * gtk_source_space_drawer_set_enable_matrix (space_drawer, TRUE);
     * ```
     * ```python
     * space_drawer.set_types_for_locations(
     *     locations=GtkSource.SpaceLocationFlags.ALL,
     *     types=GtkSource.SpaceTypeFlags.NBSP,

     *
     * - Draw all trailing spaces.
     * - If the indentation and alignment must be done with spaces, draw tabs.
     *
     * And non-breaking spaces can always be drawn, everywhere, to distinguish them

    /**
     * Subclass of [class`Gtk`.TextView].
     *
     * `GtkSourceView` is the main class of the GtkSourceView library.
     * Use a [class`Buffer]` to display text with a `GtkSourceView`.
     *
     * This class provides:
     *
     *  - Show the line numbers;
     *  - Show a right margin;
     *  - Highlight the current line;
     *  - Indentation settings;
     *  - Configuration for the Home and End keyboard keys;
     *  - Configure and show line marks;
     *  - And a few other things.
     *
     * An easy way to test all these features is to use the test-widget mini-program
     * provided in the GtkSourceView repository, in the tests/ directory.
     *
     * # GtkSourceView as GtkBuildable
     *
     * The GtkSourceView implementation of the [iface`Gtk`.Buildable] interface exposes the
     * [property`View:`completion] object with the internal-child "completion".
     *
     * An example of a UI definition fragment with GtkSourceView:
     * ```xml
     * <object class="GtkSourceView" id="source_view">
     *   <property name="tab-width">4</property>
     *   <property name="auto-indent">True</property>
     *   <child internal-child="completion">
     *     <object class="GtkSourceCompletion">
     *       <property name="select-on-show">False</property>
     *     </object>
     *   </child>
     * </object>
     * ```
     *
     * # Changing the Font
     *
     * Gtk CSS provides the best way to change the font for a `GtkSourceView` in a
     * manner that allows for components like [class`Map]` to scale the desired
     * font.
     *
     * ```c
     * GtkCssProvider *provider = gtk_css_provider_new ();
     * gtk_css_provider_load_from_string (provider,
     *                                   "textview { font-family: Monospace; font-size: 8pt; }");
     * gtk_style_context_add_provider (gtk_widget_get_style_context (view),
     *                                 GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER (provider),
     *                                 GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION);
     * g_object_unref (provider);
     * ```
     * ```python
     * provider = Gtk.CssProvider()
     * provider.load_from_string("textview { font-family: Monospace; font-size: 8pt; }")
     * style_context = view.get_style_context()
     * style_context.add_provider(provider, Gtk.STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION)
     * ```
     *
     * If you need to adjust the font or size of font within a portion of the
     * document only, you should use a [class`Gtk`.TextTag] with the [property`Gtk`.TextTag:family] or
     * [property`Gtk`.TextTag:scale] set so that the font size may be scaled relative to
     * the default font set in CSS.

    /**
     * Vim emulation.
     *
     * The `GtkSourceVimIMContext` is a [class`Gtk`.IMContext] implementation that can
     * be used to provide Vim-like editing controls within a [class`View]`.
     *
     * The `GtkSourceViMIMContext` will process incoming [class`Gdk`.KeyEvent] as the
     * user types. It should be used in conjunction with a [class`Gtk`.EventControllerKey].
     *
     * Various features supported by `GtkSourceVimIMContext` include:
     *
     *  - Normal, Insert, Replace, Visual, and Visual Line modes
     *  - Support for an integrated command bar and current command preview
     *  - Search and replace
     *  - Motions and Text Objects
     *  - History replay
     *  - Jumplists within the current file
     *  - Registers including the system and primary clipboards
     *  - Creation and motion to marks
     *  - Some commonly used Vim commands
     *
     * It is recommended that applications display the contents of
     * [property`VimIMContext:`command-bar-text] and
     * [property`VimIMContext:`command-text] to the user as they represent the
     * command-bar and current command preview found in Vim.
     *
     * `GtkSourceVimIMContext` attempts to work with additional [class`Gtk`.IMContext]
     * implementations such as IBus by querying the [class`Gtk`.TextView] before processing
     * the command in states which support it (notably Insert and Replace modes).
     *
     * ```c
     * GtkEventController *key;
     * GtkIMContext *im_context;
     * GtkWidget *view;
     *
     * view = gtk_source_view_new ();
     * im_context = gtk_source_vim_im_context_new ();
     * key = gtk_event_controller_key_new ();
     *
     * gtk_event_controller_key_set_im_context (GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_KEY (key), im_context);
     * gtk_event_controller_set_propagation_phase (key, GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE);
     * gtk_widget_add_controller (view, key);
     * gtk_im_context_set_client_widget (im_context, view);
     *
     * g_object_bind_property (im_context, "command-bar-text", command_bar_label, "label", 0);
     * g_object_bind_property (im_context, "command-text", command_label, "label", 0);
     * ```
     * ```python
     * key = Gtk.EventControllerKey.new()
     * im_context = GtkSource.VimIMContext.new()
     * buffer = GtkSource.Buffer()
     * view = GtkSource.View.new_with_buffer(buffer)
