         * Creates a binding between `source_property` on `source` and `target_property`
         * on `target,` allowing you to set the transformation functions to be used by
         * the binding.
         *
         * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
         * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
         * will be updated as well. The `transform_from` function is only used in case
         * of bidirectional bindings, otherwise it will be ignored
         *
         * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
         * `target` instances are finalized. This will release the reference that is
         * being held on the #GBinding instance; if you want to hold on to the
         * #GBinding instance, you will need to hold a reference to it.
         *
         * To remove the binding, call g_binding_unbind().
         *
         * A #GObject can have multiple bindings.
         *
         * The same `user_data` parameter will be used for both `transform_to`
         * and `transform_from` transformation functions; the `notify` function will
         * be called once, when the binding is removed. If you need different data
         * for each transformation function, please use
         * g_object_bind_property_with_closures() instead.

         * `target` instances are finalized. This will release the reference that is
         * being held on the #GBinding instance; if you want to hold on to the
         * #GBinding instance, you will need to hold a reference to it.
         *
         * To remove the binding, call g_binding_unbind().
         *
         * A #GObject can have multiple bindings.

         * Complete version of g_object_bind_property().
         *
         * Creates a binding between `source_property` on `source` and `target_property`
         * on `target,` allowing you to set the transformation functions to be used by
         * the binding.
         *
         * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
         * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
         * will be updated as well. The `transform_from` function is only used in case
         * of bidirectional bindings, otherwise it will be ignored
         *
         * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
         * `target` instances are finalized. This will release the reference that is
         * being held on the #GBinding instance; if you want to hold on to the
         * #GBinding instance, you will need to hold a reference to it.
         *
         * To remove the binding, call g_binding_unbind().
         *
         * A #GObject can have multiple bindings.
         *
         * The same `user_data` parameter will be used for both `transform_to`
         * and `transform_from` transformation functions; the `notify` function will
         * be called once, when the binding is removed. If you need different data
         * for each transformation function, please use
         * g_object_bind_property_with_closures() instead.

     * Represents an extension of the WebProcess.
     *
     * WebKitWebExtension is a loadable module for the WebProcess. It allows you to execute code in the
     * WebProcess and being able to use the DOM API, to change any request or to inject custom
     * JavaScript code, for example.
     *
     * To create a WebKitWebExtension you should write a module with an initialization function that could
     * be either webkit_web_extension_initialize() with prototype #WebKitWebExtensionInitializeFunction or
     * webkit_web_extension_initialize_with_user_data() with prototype #WebKitWebExtensionInitializeWithUserDataFunction.
     * This function has to be public and it has to use the #G_MODULE_EXPORT macro. It is called when the
     * web process is initialized.
     *
     * ```c
     * static void
     * web_page_created_callback (WebKitWebExtension *extension,
     *                            WebKitWebPage      *web_page,
     *                            gpointer            user_data)
     * {
     *     g_print ("Page %d created for %s\n",
     *              webkit_web_page_get_id (web_page),
     *              webkit_web_page_get_uri (web_page));
     * }
     *
     * G_MODULE_EXPORT void
     * webkit_web_extension_initialize (WebKitWebExtension *extension)
     * {
     *     g_signal_connect (extension, "page-created",
     *                       G_CALLBACK (web_page_created_callback),
     *                       NULL);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * The previous piece of code shows a trivial example of an extension that notifies when
     * a #WebKitWebPage is created.
     *
     * WebKit has to know where it can find the created WebKitWebExtension. To do so you
     * should use the webkit_web_context_set_web_extensions_directory() function. The signal
     * #WebKitWebContext::initialize-web-extensions is the recommended place to call it.
     *
     * To provide the initialization data used by the webkit_web_extension_initialize_with_user_data()
     * function, you have to call webkit_web_context_set_web_extensions_initialization_user_data() with
     * the desired data as parameter. You can see an example of this in the following piece of code:
     *
     * ```c
     * #define WEB_EXTENSIONS_DIRECTORY // ...
     *
     * static void
     * initialize_web_extensions (WebKitWebContext *context,
     *                            gpointer          user_data)
     * {
     *   // Web Extensions get a different ID for each Web Process
     *   static guint32 unique_id = 0;
     *
     *   webkit_web_context_set_web_extensions_directory (
     *      context, WEB_EXTENSIONS_DIRECTORY);
     *   webkit_web_context_set_web_extensions_initialization_user_data (
