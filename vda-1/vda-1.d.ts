         *   g_object_bind_property (action, "active", widget, "sensitive", 0);

         *
         *

         * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
         * instance.
         *
         * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
