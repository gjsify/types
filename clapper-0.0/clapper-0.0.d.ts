    /**
     * Represents a point in timeline.
     *
     * Markers are a convienient way of marking points of interest within a
     * [class`Clapper`.Timeline] of [class`Clapper`.MediaItem]. Use them
     * to indicate certain areas on the timeline.
     *
     * Markers are reference counted immutable objects. Once a marker is created
     * it can only be inserted into a single [class`Clapper`.Timeline] at a time.
     *
     * Please note that markers are independent of [property`Clapper`.MediaItem:duration]
     * and applications should not assume that all markers must have start/end times
     * lower or equal the item duration. This is not the case in e.g. live streams
     * where duration is unknown, but markers are still allowed to mark entries
     * (like EPG titles for example).
     *
     * Remember that [class`Clapper`.Player] will also automatically insert certain
     * markers extracted from media such as video chapters. Clapper will never
     * "touch" the ones created by the application. If you want to differentiate
     * your own markers, applications can define and create markers with one of
     * the custom types from [enum`Clapper`.MarkerType] enum.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * ```c
     * #define MY_APP_MARKER (CLAPPER_MARKER_TYPE_CUSTOM_1)
     *
     * ClapperMarker *marker = clapper_marker_new (MY_APP_MARKER, title, start, end);
     * ```
     *
     * ```c
     * ClapperMarkerType marker_type = clapper_marker_get_marker_type (marker);
     *
     * if (marker_type == MY_APP_MARKER) {
     *   // Do something with your custom marker
     * }
