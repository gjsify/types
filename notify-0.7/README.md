GJS TypeScript type definitions for Notify-0.7, generated from library version 0.8.2 using [ts-for-gir](https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir) v3.2.3.

libnotify is a library that sends desktop notifications to a notification daemon, as defined in the Desktop Notifications spec. These notifications can be used to inform the user about an event or display some form of information without getting in the user's way.

## Install

To use this type definitions, install them with NPM:
```bash
npm install @girs/notify-0.7
```

## Usage

You can import this package into your project like this:
```ts
import Notify from '@girs/notify-0.7';
```

Or if you prefer CommonJS, you can also use this:
```ts
const Notify = require('@girs/notify-0.7');
```

### Ambient Modules

You can also use [ambient modules](https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir/tree/main/packages/cli#ambient-modules) to import this module like you would do this in JavaScript.
For this you need to include `@girs/notify-0.7` or `@girs/notify-0.7/ambient` in your `tsconfig` or entry point Typescript file:

`index.ts`:
```ts
import '@girs/notify-0.7'
```

`tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  },
  "include": ["@girs/notify-0.7"],
  ...
}
```

Now you can import the ambient module with TypeScript support: 

```ts
import Notify from 'gi://Notify?version=0.7';
```

### Global import

You can also import the module with Typescript support using the global `imports.gi` object of GJS.
For this you need to include `@girs/notify-0.7` or `@girs/notify-0.7/import` in your `tsconfig` or entry point Typescript file:

`index.ts`:
```ts
import '@girs/notify-0.7'
```

`tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  },
  "include": ["@girs/notify-0.7"],
  ...
}
```

Now you have also type support for this, too:

```ts
const Notify = imports.gi.Notify;
```

### Bundle

Depending on your project configuration, it is recommended to use a bundler like [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). You can find examples using different bundlers [here](https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir/tree/main/examples).
