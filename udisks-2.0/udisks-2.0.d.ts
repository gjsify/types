         *
         * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
         * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,

         * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error

         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.

         * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and

         * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
         * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
         * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
         * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
         * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new

         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()

         * Initializes the object implementing the interface.
         *
         * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
         * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
         *
         * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
         * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
         * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
         * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
         * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
         *
         * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
         * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
         * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
         * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
         * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
         * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
         * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
         * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
         * instance.

         *
         * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,

         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
         * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
         * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error

         * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
         * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and

         * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.

         * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
         * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
         *
         * When the initialization is finished, `callback` will be called. You can
         * then call g_async_initable_init_finish() to get the result of the
         * initialization.
         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not
         * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
         * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL, and
         * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
         *
         * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
         * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
         * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
         * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
         * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
         * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times,
         * implementation requires yielding all subsequent calls to init_async() on the
         * results of the first call.
         *
         * For classes that also support the #GInitable interface, the default
         * implementation of this method will run the g_initable_init() function
         * in a thread, so if you want to support asynchronous initialization via

         * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
         * instance.

         * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
         * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
         *
         * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
         * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
         * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
         * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
         * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
         * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
         * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
         * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
         * instance.
         * @param cancellable optional #GCancellable object, %NULL to ignore.

         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
         *
         * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
         * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
         * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
         * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
         * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
         * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
         * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
         * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
         * instance.

         * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
         *
         * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
         * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
         *
         * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
         * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
         * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
         * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
         * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
         *
         * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
         * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
         * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
         * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
         *
         * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
         * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
         * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
         * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
         * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
         * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
         *
         * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
         * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
         * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
         * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
         *
         * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
         * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
         * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
         * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
         * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
         * instance.
         * @param cancellable optional #GCancellable object, %NULL to ignore.
