         * This function cleans up VEVENT, VJOURNAL, VTODO and VTIMEZONE
         * items which are to be imported into Evolution.
         *
         * Using VTIMEZONE definitions is problematic because they cannot be
         * updated properly when timezone definitions change. They are also
         * incomplete (for compatibility reason only one set of rules for
         * summer saving changes can be included, even if different rules
         * apply in different years). This function looks for matches of the
         * used TZIDs against system timezones and replaces such TZIDs with
         * the corresponding system timezone. This works for TZIDs containing
         * a location (found via a fuzzy string search) and for Outlook TZIDs
         * (via a hard-coded lookup table).
         *
         * Some programs generate broken meeting invitations with TZID, but
         * without including the corresponding VTIMEZONE. Importing such
         * invitations unchanged causes problems later on (meeting displayed
         * incorrectly, e_cal_component_get_as_string() fails). The situation
         * where this occurred in the past (found by a SyncEvolution user) is
         * now handled via the location based mapping.
         *
         * If this mapping fails, this function also deals with VTIMEZONE
         * conflicts: such conflicts occur when the calendar already contains
         * an old VTIMEZONE definition with the same TZID, but different
         * summer saving rules. Replacing the VTIMEZONE potentially breaks
         * displaying of old events, whereas not replacing it breaks the new
         * events (the behavior in Evolution <= 2.22.1).
         *
         * The way this problem is resolved by renaming the new VTIMEZONE
         * definition until the TZID is unique. A running count is appended to
         * the TZID. All items referencing the renamed TZID are adapted
         * accordingly.

         * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
         * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
         * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
         * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.

         *
