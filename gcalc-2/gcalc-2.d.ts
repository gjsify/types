         * Creates a binding between `source_property` on `source` and `target_property`
         * on `target`.
         *
         * Whenever the `source_property` is changed the `target_property` is
         * updated using the same value. For instance:
         *
         *
         * ```c
         *   g_object_bind_property (action, "active", widget, "sensitive", 0);
         * ```
         *
         *
         * Will result in the "sensitive" property of the widget #GObject instance to be
         * updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action #GObject
         * instance.
         *
         * If `flags` contains %G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL then the binding will be mutual:
         * if `target_property` on `target` changes then the `source_property` on `source`
         * will be updated as well.
         *
         * The binding will automatically be removed when either the `source` or the
         * `target` instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
         * `source` and the `target` you can just call g_object_unref() on the returned
         * #GBinding instance.
         *
         * Removing the binding by calling g_object_unref() on it must only be done if
         * the binding, `source` and `target` are only used from a single thread and it
         * is clear that both `source` and `target` outlive the binding. Especially it
         * is not safe to rely on this if the binding, `source` or `target` can be
         * finalized from different threads. Keep another reference to the binding and
         * use g_binding_unbind() instead to be on the safe side.
         *
         * A #GObject can have multiple bindings.
         * @param source_property the property on @source to bind
         * @param target the target #GObject
         * @param target_property the property on @target to bind
         * @param flags flags to pass to #GBinding
         * @returns the #GBinding instance representing the     binding between the two #GObject instances. The binding is released     whenever the #GBinding reference count reaches zero.
