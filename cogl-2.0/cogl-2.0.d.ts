     * A quaternion is comprised of a scalar component and a 3D vector
     * component. The scalar component is normally referred to as w and the
     * vector might either be referred to as v or a (for axis) or expanded
     * with the individual components: (x, y, z) A full quaternion would
     * then be written as <literal>[w (x, y, z)]</literal>.
     *
     * Quaternions can be considered to represent an axis and angle
     * pair although sadly these numbers are buried somewhat under some
     * maths...
     *
     * For the curious you can see here that a given axis (a) and angle (𝜃)
     * pair are represented in a quaternion as follows:
     *
     * ```
     * [w=cos(𝜃/2) ( x=sin(𝜃/2)*a.x, y=sin(𝜃/2)*a.y, z=sin(𝜃/2)*a.x )]
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Unit Quaternions:
     * When using Quaternions to represent spatial orientations for 3D
     * graphics it's always assumed you have a unit quaternion. The
     * magnitude of a quaternion is defined as:
     *
     * ```
     * sqrt (w² + x² + y² + z²)
     * ```
     *
     * and a unit quaternion satisfies this equation:
     *
     * ```
     * w² + x² + y² + z² = 1
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Thankfully most of the time we don't actually have to worry about
     * the maths that goes on behind the scenes but if you are curious to
     * learn more here are some external references:
